      I was born RONALD ALFRED HUSSEY on April 8th. 1923, which you will
      perceive, makes me 77 next month. I was born on a Sunday at 4.a.m.
      supposedly life's lowest ebb. If you get past 4 you are OK. for that
      night. I came into this world at 151 Maple Road, Penge, London S.E.20. My
      Mother's name was Rosemary and my Father's was Henry. He was a Master
      Baker and worked for Price the large Bakery at Thornton Heath. I had 2
      sisters and a brother. Eldest sister named Frances (nick name Moggy!)
      youngest sister named Winifred, brother named Benjamin. There were two
      other children who died before I was born. A girl named Rolly and a boy
      named Willie who I know was run over and killed by a horse and cart. An
      interesting but sad reflection on the Church of the day (Church of
      England)!  Rolly died before she was Christened,  and was refused burial
      in sacred ground! We lived in a large Victorian 4 story house next to a
      Public House called "THE LONDON TAVERN." Maple Road was noted for having
      a very busy &amp; popular street market and it was quite an exciting
      place to grow up in. We had no electricity in the house then, just gas
      and candles. An old couple who lived downtairs shared the house. The
      entrance to the front door was up a flight of steps through to a passage
      that had the old couples parlour  and bedroom on that level and then 2
      rooms down stairs in the semi basement. We climbed the stairs to our
      scullery, which held the cooker and copper, then up more stairs to our
      kitchen and very large front room as it was called in those days. The
      walls of the scullery were distempered and when the copper was going full
      blast it was not uncommon for  flakes of distemper to find its way into
      the food! You can imagine what a chore it must have been for Mum to cook
      and carry the meals up those stairs all day! The kitchen was quite large
      and cosy in the winter with the old kitchen range  glowing and the kettle
      always on the boil! I remember a huge mirror above the mantlepiece where
      my sisters used to stand to see how their dance frocks hung,(not when Dad
      was around however!)The other point I need to impress on young readers of
      the family is, THERE WAS  NO HOT WATER! Every  drop had to be heated by
      kettle! Even for baths! Our front room was quite spacious, two huge
      windows looked out onto Maple road and you also had a view of the
      forecourt of the Pub next door and all the activity associated with it
      and of that, there was plenty! More of that later! There was a nice
      fireplace and a large upright piano and a huge real hide sofa that all
      the family did their courting on in their turn under the eagle  eye of
      Mother I might add! We also had a huge Gramophone with the largest horn I
      have ever seen. This was my Dads pride and joy, he was an intense music
      lover and he must have passed it onto all his children as we all have a
      love of good music. My two sisters were lucky enough to have been taught
      the piano, whilst young Ben learned the hard way by himself much to the
      chagrin and despair of the poor old couple down stairs and anyone within
      earshot! Naturally with his love of good music my dad soon acquired
      wireless in the form of a Cats Whisker type or Crystal Set! This was a
      real Heath Robinson Affair and you will have to read history books to
      learn how it worked as it was beyond me! I only know that when he was
      operating it we dare not breathe or make a sound! I hope you can gather
      from these rambling words that it was a cosy happy family house? Then to
      carry on the rest of the house, we had two bedrooms up stairs, I always
      remember my parents bedroom because as I will tell you soon, I was a
      poorly child and spent most of my baby life in my mothers bed. I think
      that is what made me fond of women! There was a huge Victorian wardrobe
      that went from floor to ceiling and took up the entire length of one long
      wall, it must have been over 12 feet in length! It was beautifully hand
      made with out a screw in it, all jointed, with huge trays and drawers and
      even a place for ladies hats and mens Toppers! The front panels were all
      hand painted, it really was an imposing piece of furniture, My dad was a
      home lover and being lucky enough to be in work during the depression was
      able to pick up bargains such as this at the Croydon  auctions. The
      curtains in the front room I remember were also very classy as was the
      huge Chandelier with over 250 pieces, real horror to clean but beautiful
      with the sun on it throwing lovely colours all round the room. The huge
      wardrobe was a cause of many sleepless Saturday nights for me. Saturday
      night was the only night my Dad did not work and the custom in those days
      was to go to the Pub, my kind Brother Ben, who was ten years my senior
      used to take a delight in telling me there was a Bogey Man in the
      wardrobe! As I only used to have a candle for light, which flickered and
      cast eerie shadows around the room, I was easily convinced that there
      was! The other thing about the room was the bed! It was a huge feather
      bed and you used to sink right into it and feel so warm. Of course the
      feature of living in those GOOD OLD DAYS as they are called was we were
      always fighting to keep warm! There was no heat at all in the house until
      someone got up and lit the fire with paper and sticks. There were the
      usual fireplaces in all the rooms, bedrooms as well, though these were
      seldom lit unless one was ill and the Panel Doctor was visiting, coal was
      very expensive. So that were our living quarters, and downstairs lived a
      couple named Baker, he was a snob. No! Not stuck up, but a BOOT REPAIRER!
      , and a very good one, I used to spend hours down there watching him
      strip soles off and amazed at how many nails he could keep in his mouth
      and the dexterity he hit them in with a file and to watch him stitch
      shoes was an education. He was a hard man to get in touch with, in
      contrast to his wife named Jakey. She was the nearest I have ever known
      to a living Angel! Aunty Lilly will bear me out as she knows all about
      her and her wonderful and unselfish way of life. This was more evident
      after the death of my Dad as then we fell on hard times and she came up
      trumps in so many ways. My eldest sister Moggy, was a dress maker for a
      very exclusive dressmaker to the Court and used to bring home the most
      exquisite clothes to finish off if it was a rush job.  She was being
      courted by one Edgar James Pink who you will learn more of in due course.
      My youngest sister Winnie was also courting, her Beaus name was TED
      ANDREWS and I recall they used to work together at a Card and Calendar
      Printing firm named OLIPHANTS in Anerley road. My memory can recall that,
      but not where I was last Friday! I don't recall if brother Ben had girl
      friends at that tender age, but if he didn't, he sure made up for it
      later!  That's a brief idea of the family and our living conditions in
      the 1920s.Maple Road began at the High St. where the Market started and
      finished at Anerley Hill, which ran up to the East Tower of CRYSTAL
      PALACE and Anerley Road ran up ANERLEY HILL to the West Tower.  Of course
      to the Parade where you could get a bus to most places in London plus
      there were two Railway stations to serve the thousands of people who
      attended all the concerts, Speedway, Fairs, Exhibitions, big Sporting
      occasions etc, a very popular place. The Market stall licenses were
      granted to ex-servicemen returning after the first World War and handed
      down from father to son. If you went there now, you would almost
      certainly find the same families still operating there. The Prouds,
      Smiths, Hutchings, Rabbit Read, Fishy Harrison etc. Shops also lined the
      road and I'm sure I read somewhere that TESCOS had their first store here
      in the Market. It was a busy exciting place in the market! All the
      vendors shouting out their prices and cheeking the old ladies in their
      inimitable fashion with the Butchers speaking to each other in Butchers
      Back slang so the customers could not know what they were saying about
      them! Unlike to day, the shops had no such luxuries as Refrigerators, as
      there was no electricity! When it came to Saturday there was a frantic
      almost panic-stricken rush to sell off everything as any thing unsold
      would not be edible by Monday! So picture the scene on a Saturday
      night...  Remember, the urchins would have been pulling the heavily laden
      stalls to the market from nearby lockups by hand. From 6 in the morning,
      wet or fine. Then there was the beetroot to cook, the greens to trim, the
      brussels to top and tail, apples to polish and generally dress the
      stalls. So now all the poor hard up mothers would appear on the scene
      with their few coppers to snap up the bargains and there were plenty to
      be had. It was an education to see how these Marketeers could hold a
      crowd together with a few jokes and saucy asides as they cajoled their
      customers with a few sweeteners and then managed to get them to part with
      their precious pennies for a joint of beef etc. Some poor souls would be
      seen round the back of the fruit and veg stalls picking up the bruised
      and discarded items. By this time the whole market would be alive with
      the bustling hurried shoppers frantically endeavouring to get a cheap
      meal for Sunday.  Specially at the Butchers, where everyone hoped to get
      some sort of joint, this would be the talking point for the week! All the
      time the Stalls and shops, all lit by Kerosene lamps that let out quite a
      cheerful buzzing noise, specially when pumped up.  All the time there
      would be buskers and street vendors such as the Hot Chestnut man with his
      Brazier glowing, The Sarsparilla man with his hot drinks, the usual Old
      Soldier selling boot laces and iron holders etc. You must remember at
      this time there were no shops open on Sundays, so it was imperative to
      get all your shopping done Saturday, especially as those days people had
      large families to feed. Gradually the last of the shoppers having gone,
      leaving only the really hard up people who would be scrounging around,
      for specks and perhaps some bones from a kindly butcher. Then the
      clearing up began, all the stalls tidying up with the stall holders all
      keeping up a dialogue of insults to one another in a friendly fashion,
      loads of kids trying to earn a few coppers pulling the stalls back to
      their lock ups. The Butchers by now had buckets of scalding hot water for
      scrubbing down their cutting blocks etc. A wonderful exciting place for a
      kid to grow up I can tell you, although it was no place for weaklings,
      only the fittest survived! Also located in Maple road was THE SALVATION
      ARMY CITADEL, which boasted a truly magnificent Band that was a sight to
      see marching through the Town on Sunday morning! Then just up the road
      was a huge TABERNACLE that used to have a large congregation and was also
      the home of the local Scout &amp; Cub group. Farther up the road was
      CARTER PATERSON the famous Carriers, they must have had over 100 horses
      there, in later years this was taken over by a BUTTON FACTORY which
      simply made buttons! An Interesting, but sad note about this is, it was
      an Italian firm and had many Italians working there. Come the outbreak of
      War, they were all interned and they were shipped out to Canada on the
      ill fated ship THE ATHENIA which was sunk by U-BOAT with total loss of
      life! St. JOHN's INFANT SCHOOL, of which it was my fate to join, was also
      in Maple road, right in the middle of the market, other features of Penge
      which by the way was an URBAN DISTRICT COUNCIL with a London post
      mark..S.E.20.and was bordered by CROYDON, BECKENHAM, DULWICH, SYDENHAM,
      NORWOOD etc. We had a famous theatre in the high st. THE PENGE EMPIRE,
      which was part of the MOSS EMPIRE and had all the big stars of Music Hall
      appearing there. It was a special treat to go there on a Friday, as that
      was carnival night with balloons and surprise gifts for lucky people!
      There are also to be seen there today,  ALMS HOUSES for the LIGHTERMEN
      &amp; WATERMEN of the River Thames, they are classified as Heritage
      houses and are quite interesting to visit. One other interesting feature
      of Penge is the RAILWAY TUNNEL that runs under the CRYSTAL PALACE to
      SYDENHAM. It is actually a mile long, remember this was in the days of
      steam trains and it was, and still is, the main line to the KENT COAST.
      In our young days with the girls it was akin to the mile high club! Say
      no more! It was always a thrill to stand on the foot- bridge that passed
      over the tracks and to see and hear the famous "FLYING SCOTSMAN" with its
      PULLMAN COACHES all lit up and the people sitting at their tables. We
      must have looked very weird to all the passengers, as standing there with
      all the soot coming off the engine we must have looked like ZULU's!! The
      passengers would be having their meal served to them and how we would
      look at them with envy! All the trains leaving the tunnel and approaching
      PENGE EAST STATION were obliged to blow their whistle and what with that
      and the sound of the train rushing at breakneck speed it was very
      exciting I can tell you! Of course the Crystal Palace was a fantastic
      place for everyone living in the vicinity, so much went on there, it also
      incorporated a large Public Park which was a boys delight, here we could
      go climbing. There is a large Lake with boats and a big Island with life
      size PREHISTORIC ANIMALS in natural surroundings, don't ask me to spell
      their names, but they are quite something to see even today. In those
      days it was one of the Premier show places of the South of England,
      famous for it's CHOIRS, ORGAN RECITALS, EXHIBITION, FAIRS and dozens of
      famous SPORTING EVENTS, I actually saw JACK DOYLE fight there! Then of
      course there was the fabulous CRYSTAL PALACE SPEEDWAY TEAM! WHAT a TEAM!
      It was the largest track on the circuit so it was also the fastest and we
      never missed a match! Naturally being local tearaways we never actually
      paid to get in, on the Friday we would be up there preparing our special
      place were we could bunk in! In later years after the war, they had motor
      car racing but it became too popular and the local residents put a stop
      to it. Of course, it still holds major Athletics Meetings there and is
      really a nice place for families now as it has been well looked after,
      and even boasts a CHILDREN'S PETTING ZOO. There was also a DRILL HALL in
      Penge,  which housed a detachment of the ROYAL WEST KENT'S. Sadly, when
      War broke out they were among the first troops into France and suffered
      terrible casualties resulting in very few surviving DUNKIRK! I must
      mention here that the next road over from us was BLENHEIM ROAD,  which in
      those days was a slum road, but dare not tell anyone who lived there!
      Even in those poverty stricken days amongst the poorest of the poor there
      was a class division. We in Maple road for instance thought we were
      better class than people of Blenheim, people in the next turning to us
      who had gardens etc used to look down on us! So you can see, nothing
      changes! One thing that always sticks in my mind is, how things seemed to
      work better in those days! The postman looked and dressed like a postman!
      Like the Baker, Milkman and Paperboy, you could set your watches if you
      had one, by them. Two deliveries of mail a day, milkman came round twice,
      second time with milk for puddings, Baker would have all sorts of lovely
      things in his basket and we could go to the Bakers and with two pennies
      scraped up between us could buy a big bag of stale cakes! A special treat
      was on a Friday night, which in those days was payday. Dad would send me
      down Maple road for SAVELOYS and PEASE PUDDING! What a treat! Another
      treat was a tuppeny and penuff and a big bottle of TIZER! Give 'em a
      tanner (6pence) and you got a penny back! So ended the Twenties!<br>
      Before entering the THIRTIES, I should perhaps mention here that when
      just a baby learning to walk, I fell and hit my back which set off T.B.
      in my left leg. This developed into a serious condition, so much so in
      fact, the Hospital decided to amputate! One day out in the pram, our
      faithful Salvation Army Insurance Man persuaded my Mother to take me to a
      Herbalist in Portland Road South Norwood. After examining me, he informed
      my mother that he could cure the condition but it would be a long haul
      and would take a lot of intense nursing etc. Of course, my Mum jumped at
      the chance and so years of intense care and devoted nursing paid off. My
      leg used to swell to an enormous size and erupted from time to time. I
      can remember all the poultices Mum used to apply, the special baths and
      foods, VIROL I remember very well as it was very pleasant to take and it
      was a nice form of soft Malt toffee. All this meant I didn't walk until I
      was around 5, in time to go to school, which happened to be in the road I
      lived! I still remember the Headmistress. Miss Catchpole! (Big Gran told
      me she used to take you to Southend and bury your legs in the mud at low
      tide - right?   Tony Pink note*)<br>
            Another fond memory comes to mind during this period. Living
      opposite, were a family named the BIRMINGHAMS, show business people, 2
      married sisters used to do song and dance act round the many variety
      theatres that abounded in those days. One of the sisters had a daughter
      same age as me, she used to come over and play with me when I was house
      bound. I suppose that is why, that all through my life, I have always
      been very comfortable with ladies in my bedroom!<font face=
