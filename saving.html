              Saving While Courting
            </h2>We saved for five years into a Post Office Savings Account,
            and I withdrew a lump sum to pay for part of this furniture. We
            still use the chairs about the house today, but the table and
            sideboard were passed on to Lesley and Alan.<br>

            Of an evening we might walk from Strood to Luton Arches on the left
            hand side of the road, looking in all the shop windows. Then at the
            far end of Chatham High Street, cross over and walk all the way
            back on the other side. Then, about 9.00pm. after a coffee (made
            with milk) I might lash out on a 'brown bus' - Chatham &amp;
            District Traction Co. - fare - one penny! to the Town Hall
            (Chatham) and walk up Chatham Hill to our house in Park Avenue,
            Gillingham.
