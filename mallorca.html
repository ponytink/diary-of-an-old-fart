    I arrived in Mallorca for my usual weeks break about my birthday time, 11th
    September. I was early this year, 2004 and on 4th September, a Saturday, I
    awoke and fixed myself a coffee and sat about waiting for the others to
    come to. I was told to pack my bag as we were off to Can Picaforte and the
    beach for a couple of days, and to bring some smart trousers for the
    evenings. After having done all that, Valerie said "where's your camera?" -
    In the case I said "Well take it out because we are not going to the beach.
    <b>we are going to Seville</b>". She had been hoping to get me all the way
    to the airport without me finding out where we were going, but it got too
    scary for her I fancy !<br>

          we travelled Air Berlin. Very efficient, as you would expect. The
          attractive fraulines had their smiles fixed on their faces I noticed.
          We were met at the Airport by Romancho, Marcelo's brother, and we
          collected a little fiat uno and followed Romancho for a ten minute
          drive to his home in Tomares. We were welomed first, by a silly old
          dog called Tuco, and then with hugs and kisses all round by Cristina,
          Romancho's wife. They, like the rest of the family earn their living
          by singing, and that evening had a regular weekly gig in Ayamonte,
          some two hours drive, 140 kms, right down to the Portuguese border
          near Faro. Marcelo and I helped load the wagon up with amplification
          and set off for the venue. It was a very large new hotel complex with
          every possible amenity. We helped set up the gear and Romancho
          suggested Alex took us to the fishing village to get a meal, and that
          we return for the second set. The meal was a never ending succession
          of seafood. One can't describe the excellence of it all, an oval
          platter of sliced tomatoes and chopped garlic, a bowl full of little
          sea shells which had been boiled in, at a guess white wine. Little
          shrimps in wine, squids, whitebait thingies, prawns in garlic, a
          large dish of sardines, then cuttlefish. (sopia). Excellent dry white
          wine and fresh crusty bread<br>

          We left for the venue, which was al fresco, and there were a few
          people listening. Cristina then sang a song which I knew was just for
          me, and we had a drink (a 103 for me) and heard the end of the
          session which was Mambo No 5!, helped pack the gear away and return
          to Tomares. Once home we had a coffee and another drink and sat
          talking for a while, as you do. It was pretty late by that time and
          it had been a long day. I had thought I was going to Can Pic to the
          beach remember! Then they said you had better slip your shoes on as
          we are going down to the feria in the village. Well! If you hadn't
          seen it with your own eyes you wouldn't have believed it. 3,00 am.
          The main street was in full swing with candy floss, ice creams,
          music. Every family had their own reception tent and drinks were
          offered everywhere. Everyone knew everyone else. I was introduced to
          so many people I didn't know whether I was coming or going. In the

    After visiting Val and Marcelo for over 25 years, first at Impala III, then
    later at Rector Vives. They have finally sold their house in Genova and
    bought a house in Costitx, just SSE of Inca. It has 11,000 metros quadrados
    of campo and oodles of fruit trees, some with 2 fruits on each tree! i.e.
    plums and almonds on the same tree. The mind boggles. - can't wait to see
    it.<br>

    The cats took to it like ducks to water, with the exception of Pachanga,
    who sadly is very nervous. Pussy Cat, on the other hand has a new lease of
    life and is up early every morning, out, across the garden and over the
    wall for a rummage. (Pussy Cat has since become old and has now died. - She
    had a good innings and enjoyed her last days in Costitx.) Gris. Well he's
    just the same as always - Gris!<br>
    <br>
    Some months on now, I am pleased to report that Pachanga has settled and
    everyone is very comfortable in their new home. Most important of all is
    the arrival of Valerie's first grandchild - Aysha. Abuela Val! - Who'd a
    thought it?<br>

    Manolo and Teresa on May 7th 2006 produced a special little bundle of joy -
    namely <b>Aysha Diaz Turk</b>, born at the Son Dureta Hospital, Genova,
    Mallorca. I have yet to have the pleasure of a visit and a cuddle, although
    I have decided I may like to push the pram down to the village when I
    arrive in September.

    their turn in the baby sitting queue. I can see Aysha will finish being a
    little spoilt if we are not careful. - I am very pleased to see that she
    does NOT use a dummy. Also that she is a bit keen on my favourite WINNIE

            My! how she has grown from a little wrinkly into a cuddly bundle!
            She is a very patient and observant little person, not causing
            undue stress by needing to be picked up every tip and turn. She
            seems very happy just sitting in her rocker and watching things
            about her. I don't suppose this will last for long. (I can remember
            Teresa rushing about at a very early age and banging full pelt into
            every available obstruction, not to mention her getting her feet
            trapped under the automatic doors at Gatwick)

            </center>I took this photo at breakfast on the patio the first
            morning we were there. (John and I September 2007) Aysha took just
            a little while to get used to our presence, but I noticed how well
            she mixed with other children when we were out. - Not to mention
            even attempting to climb lamp posts like the older boys!<br>
            <br>
            One disappointment for Val. - She was hoping to have Aysha speak
            English indoors and Spanish while out. - First signs are that it
            will be Spanish! "-Mas!" + "Esta!" + "PaPa". She has also developed
            an inbetween language entirely of her own making<br>

            visit the photo album, and don't forget to add a little note to my
            guestbook. I find the bits other people have written better than the
            site itself!!
