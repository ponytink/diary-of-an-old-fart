        Meeting Alan Robinson, Colin Martin and Co.
      </h2>
      <hr>
    </center>Very early in 1970 I was walking through the High Street,
    Rochester and passing the Eagle Tavern I heard again that unmistakable
    sound of trumpet and clarinet. I stopped in my tracks and went into the pub
    and bought a light ale. (I was never much of a drinker) In a room at the
    back of the bar were a gang of young people struggling with an arrangement
    of some kind. Colin was doing his best with a trumpet, although he was
    really the piano man! If my memory serves me rightly, Alan asked me if I
    played anything, and I answered that in the distant past I played trumpet.
    Colin was reinstated on piano and I did probably a blues or similar. I said
    I could borrow one maybe for next week, and Bill Owen who owned a pram shop
    in Gillingham lent me his cornet for the following week. I returned and the
    lads taught me the in's and out's of 'ole miss rag'. Standing at the
    entrance to the room as I did the week before was Dave Straker. He said he
    used to play the banjo with the Imperial jazzband in Nottingham, and could
    pop home a get his banjo. Well that made a world of difference straight
    away! Somehow there was mention of a gig at Cuxton working man's club and I
    enlisted the help of Bernie Cuckow, who played bass, amongst other things
    and Freddy Wright, a nice guitarist played drums, but Alan and I made the
    front line with maybe Ron Weller or Roy Burton (?). From that gig Bernie
    Smith joined us. He lived in Cuxton and had a drum kit. - He became our
    drummer and we went into serious practice mode, Dave Straker teaching me
    tunes by ear.- I can remember (and still do) struggling with some barbeque!

            'Evening Post' talent spotting evening. We were paid for the job
            and not in the competition. One of the contestants - Trudie
            Neilson, said she had an audition with PYE records and would we be
            able to accompany her? Seemed a good bet. She was pretty so we
            suggested she came to Ralph Hayward's house one day next week for a
            run through. She wanted to do "Bei mer bist du schön". Well, we
            tried in g min she said it was too high, we tried again in D min
            but that was too high. We worked all the way down till we got to G
            min again and found she was a musical no no!

    From there, Ralph and Terry Wells said they knew the steward at the 'Con'
    club - The constitutional Club in Military Road Chatham, where the Deep
    Bayou Band had played years before, and said they would approach him for an
    chance to play there. We started there on a Friday night, unpaid, but
    charging membership to the club on the door. 2/6d. a week membership. It
    went very well. There were one or two anecdotes to report from there. One
    was that never to play Eric Joyce, the Steward snooker for money. He was
    shit hot! and he also sang a fair vocal. One night we were playing and some
    geyser in a fur coat came up and asked for our autographs. I said we would
    do one more number then we would take a break, and would see him at the
    bar. We played the interval number and I went up to the bar and asked Eric
    if he had seen the guy in a fur coat. "yeah" he said "I chucked him out, we
    don't want that sort in here!" About a week later, standing at the bar was
    Roland Jones, the manager of the Central Hall. I clocked him and elected to
    play one of our more rehearsed numbers, then took an interval. He said he
    was looking for an act to open the Mike and Bernie Winter's show. Just
    seven minutes, and two houses could we do it? - How much said I - £30 said
    he, Done said I - and would you believe with that money I bought eight
    pairs of trousers, eight shirts and eight cravats (see the photo above)<br>

            </h2>Ken Mullins used to write a weekly column in the Kent Evening
            Post. He seemed to favour our band a great deal and chose to write
            the most favourable columns about us. A colleague of his, Arthur
            Prosser drew strip stories for the KM and had produced a book about
            the history of the Medway. He also like a bit of jazz, and I
            suppose on a slack day decided to draw us. We used this as our logo
            from then on in..... Thanks Arthur. A real touch of genius!<br>

              GEORGE MELLY with Tony Pink
            </h2>The gamble that paid off was the one taken by Tony Pink and
            his Jazzmen when the Strood musicians booked the Central Hall,
            Chatham, for a jazz show last Friday.<br>
            <br>
            They featured not only their own distinctive style, but also the
            music of John Mason's Jazzmen, Terry Treagus Jazz Sounds and the
            jazz singer George Melly, who is pictured here with trumpeter Tony
            Pink. More than 600 people turned up for the concert which provided
            a tremendous boost for jazz in the Medway area.<br>
            <br>
            "We didn't make a lot of money" said Tony afterwards "but the
            reception was great and I am now booking the Central Hall for a
            similar show next Autumn." A week earlier the Strood jazzmen did
            extremely well at the London's Victoria Palace.<br>

            <h2>
              Royal Marine's Dinner_Dance
            </h2>One thing that never ceased to amaze me:- The Royal Marine
            Band booked us every year for their Annual Dinner and Dance. I told
            myself it couldn't be a flook, they had us back year after year.
            The same with the 100 Club in Oxford Street. We played there
            backing Humphrey Lyttleton, and were booked back there several
            times as a support group to various well known bands such as Terry
            Lightfoot, Acker Bilk and the Avon Cities Jazz Bands.<br>
            <br>
            There was something magical about playing at the 100 Club. It was
            like the Mecca for English Jazz, and to appear there was the
            pinnacle of our career. Even more than that, our bass player, Dave
            Veryard who was at the same time playing with the Kent Youth
            Orchestra would play the 100 Club with us until 1.30 am on a
            Saturday night, come home about 3.00 in the morning and have to be
            back at the Royal Festival Hall for a Youth Concert the same
            afternoon!<br>
            <br>
            About the same time we were offered a season at the Victoria Palace
            Theatre Having appeared there as an "opener" for a charity show for
            "OLD BEN" The News Trade's Charity with Leslie Crowther as top of
            the bill. We had to decline as we were all in full time employment
            and only played for the fun of it basically.
