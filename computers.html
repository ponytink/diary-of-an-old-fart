            Following our success with <b>"Computernews"</b> at the wholesale
            depot, in about 1978 I had bought a <b>"PET COMPUTER"</b> which
            stored all it's program on audio tapes, and held everything in it's
            <b>8kb</b> memory until it was "saved" back to tape. I joined a
            night school class at Fort Horsted, and under the expert guidance
            from Steve Davis, learnt basic computer programming at a cost of
            £8.00 for the year!<br>
            <br>
            It was not very long before I had transferred the magazine orders
            to a computer database which printed out the orders neatly for the
            user. We still worked from the paper sheets, but when they became
            un-useable through wear and tear, the computer would be up-dated
            and a fresh print-out obtained.<br>
            <br>
            I had originally bought the computer to write a payroll program,
            because the cost of the computer was about £425 and we were paying
            a computer firm 2/6d. a week per pay record for something like 35
            pay records. You could see that money could be saved by owning your
            own computer and writing your own software. I had a run in with the
            Inland Revenue over charging the computer to the firm. They said it
            would not be possible for a toy to used for a business, and
            business computers would cost many thousands of pounds. However,
            using the PET, I had written successfully a payroll for S/D which
            computed 135 pay records every week for the Dartford, Sheerness and
            Chatham branches. A job which took Mrs Jean Dorrington 40 hours to
            work out by hand. She was retiring and my program, once updated
            with any changes to overtime etc., ran and printed out payslips in
            about 20 minutes! complete with all analysis of departments,
            attachment to earnings etc., and correctly calculated the tax and
            NHI as per the tables. (I passed the formula to <b>SAGE PAYROLL</b>
            in later years)<br>
            <br>
            Because of my interest in the computer scene I joined the <b>Medway
            Computer and Robotics Club</b> which met at Fort Horsted where I
            had attended my basic computer classes. It was run by enthusiast<b>
            Paul Cameron,</b> and he very ably demonstrated such things as data
            transfer via a serial bus and data storage and retrieval on various
            media of the day, - Before hard drives arrived on the scene. When
            the facility at the college ended we used to meet in his house in
            Walderslade with one or two die hards wielding Spectrum computers,
            Pet Computers, an Apple, a BBC Micro. - Possibly others. it was
            Pauls aim to write an adventure game that used straight forward
            "data files" so that each of us could design our own "game" and the
            data could be swapped between machines, what ever their operating
            system. -The project was never finished, although it was fun along
            the way.<br>
