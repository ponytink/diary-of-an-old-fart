          </center>Wednesday 16th February, we were met by Arun at 8.25 to go
          down to the Train station and take a ride from Ooty (Udagamandalam)
          to Coonoor. About a one hour journey. Only 7 RPs each. There he met
          us and we set off on the long drive to Cochin. We drove till 11.00
          and stopped for a pee, then on again until 2.00 when we stopped for a
          cuppa. Marcelo took our photograph with the little finger crooked in
          true British style. Before we left Valerie crossed the road and
          bought a coconut from the elderly man with a stall on the opposite
          side of the road. In the event we all ventured across and tried it. -
          Very nice. He was so pleased with the unexpected customers that he
          unlocked the gateway into a garden behind him and picked a flower and
          returned to give to Valerie.- Another example here of the
          extraordinary nature of the Indian folk. After having enjoyed another
          pee, the cup of tea each and the chat with the coconut seller
          opposite, I went up and paid for the four teas. 20 RPs As we were
          getting back into the mini bus, the little man came running out to us
          with the 20 RPs I had paid and said the other gentleman had already
          paid!. - Mean sod that I am I accepted it back and gave him 5 RPs for
          himself. Just amazing!

          Arun was right. It was a long long way to Cochin. Although the
          journey was long, the view from the mini coach window was always
          fascinating. So much to see. Just as it was beginning to get dusk we
          arrived finally at the Hotel Trident in Cochin. We said our farewells
          to Arun who said he was going to drive all the way back to Bangalore
          (12 hours) where he would begin the trips all over again. Here we
          checked in and had a snack meal in the bar area before going to bed
          early. I remember the rooms smelled damp and the windows did not
          open. Valerie said her room smelled of lemon spray and damp mixed. It
          was not good. After the excellence of Holiday Inn Ooty, I suppose we
          had been spoilt. The next morning our new guide, Clive emerged. He
          escorted us to the Jewish area in Cochin where we visited shops and
          churches and finally the little Synagogue in Jewtown. It was built in
          1568 and is the last remaining synagogue in India. At one time there
          were in excess of 30,000 Jews living and working in India, but now,
          in Cochin there are only 22 remaining. They have no Rabbi, but the
          men take turns at conducting the services. The floor tiles were all
          hand painted with willow patterns and every one is different, and
          everything in such very good condition. - Quite amazing.

            We took lunch in a local restaurant, The Hotel Abad. Really
            excellent, and then we went down to the harbour where a boat was
            waiting for us. It would have seated 20 /30 people, but there were
            only four of us plus Clive the guide. We then set off on a very
            memorable tour of the waters surrounding Cochin. Clive told us that
            you could buy properties here for as little as £5,000 overlooking
            the river estuary. Once the Island was only accessible by ferry
            boat, but last year they built three enormous bridges which linked
            the Island to the mainland by road, and now the whole lifestyle of
            the people has changed. On our trip we saw the Chinese fishing
            nets, lots of little boats trawling for fish. Dug out paddle boats
            fishing, huge chinese long boats fishing. At various points along
            the coast were jetties where fish markets were being held. At least
            you could be sure your fish was fresh!

              Cochin, we went to a theatre where the local Folklore was retold
              in dance and mime. Rather like a silent opera. First we watched
              the two dancers being made up. That took an hour. Then we had a
              demonstration of the hand signs used and the facial expressions
              employed in the dances, and finally the dance itself.
