          </center>Well they used to be until Sarah got hold of them! In the
          very beginning we had bought the shop in October 1975 from Messrs.
          Bill Sabin and Tony Cowley, who's respective wives were Mary
          <b>GORDON</b> and Wendy <b>JAY</b>. The staff that were there stayed
          on with us. Barbara Swindin was the manageress. There were also
          Valerie, Janet and Gladys and a Saturday girl named Judith<br>
          <br>
          As both Bill and Tony worked for "Valentine's Cards" the shop was
          predominently a card and gift shop, with a few magazines thrown in. I
          had ideas that we could move our 'vast wholesale trade counter'
          there. allowing trade customers to buy in from the display there, and
          also to air our wares to the public. We never got round to that, but
          never the less the shop gradually weaned itself off cards and gifts
          to become a full blooded newsagents.<br>
          <br>
          Our original newsbill was in the area of £300.00 per week. We had a
          small notebook which contained the orders for cutomers magazines. Not
          many, and with much crossing out and in no particular order, so I
          installed a loose leaf system similar to that at the warehouse with
          each publication on a separate sheet., and of course there was only
          one wholesaler to deal with in those days. - (us!)<br>
          <br>
          I wrote the intial version of the 'orders book' using the Pet
          Computer, which of course loaded from tape and stored everything in
          it's 8k of memory. (It was in fact very fast) After struggling with
          code from about 8.00 in the morning, one day Lorraine saw fit to pop
          up to where I was working and put the kettle on for a cuppa. As you
          can imagine my screen went dead when she pulled my plug out, and the
          two hours work was lost! - Anyway, I progressed from there and wrote
          a functional payroll, a ledger system for our bookkeeping and one for
          John's business at High Halstow. Not to mention a complex payroll
          system for Surridge Dawson, Chatham. All quite amazing considering we
          were all mostly self taught in those days. I did venture into City
          and Guilds computer studies comprising Fortran and Cobol languages
          among other things, but it seemed very uphill and most of what I
          needed to do was within the scope of Basic (with the line numbers! -
          remember !!)
