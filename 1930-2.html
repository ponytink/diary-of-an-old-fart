          We have all heard the expression “I could write a book about it”
          Well, I must have said it a dozen times at least. The problem is
          where to begin. As with most things, at the beginning, is as good an
          answer as you could expect to a stupid question like that. For my
          sins, I have led a charmed life over the past seventy one years.
          There are many instances where one of my father’s favourite
          utterances, better born lucky than rich, has been proven to be
          absolutely true. I consider myself to have been very lucky in
          everything I have undertaken. Those who have known me will testify to
          the fact I do not plan things very well, and tend to bluff my way
          through when I get out of my depth. When I undertook to write
          computer programs in the early days of PCs I seldom put pencil to
          paper, just sat at the computer and typed away night and day until a
          program emerged. Once that was completed and the weaknesses were
          highlighted, then a re-write was inevitable. I still do everything
          the hard way. The front and back page of this book have been designed
          by Daniel, my right hand computer graphics whiz kid. All that remains
          to be done is for the trivia to be recounted with which to fill this
          proposed masterpiece. <img src="1930-2-1.jpg" align="left"

            This is me at a tender age outside 115 Pickhurst Rise, probably
            aged about 5. Notice the horse drawn baker's cart in the
            background. At first I attended HAWSE DOWN Infant's School, with
            Miss Robinson being the Head teacher. No sooner had I started there
            in 1939 than war broke out, and I can remember whilst my dad was at
            work on a Sunday, Mr Hayward from 113 coming over when the sirens
            sounded for a practice, and making us all get under the dining room
            table. We never hid under there again but dad moved the player
            piano adjacent to the main wall of the house and we slept on a
            mattress beside the piano occasionally if the bombing got heavy.
            Failing that, we stayed in our own beds, sometimes watching the
            'show' from the back bedroom window. The searchlights towards
            London were constantly sweeping the skies, and the ack ack flew all
            over the shop hitting very little!
          </p>When the bombing started on a regular basis the school was closed
          and we had half day lessons for about six of us at a time in one or
          another's homes, when a teacher would call. That didn't last long and
          we eventually went back to school which now had air raid shelters
          (smelly places) and we all had our gas masks. Towards the end of the
          war I used to 'help' the milkman all day on a Saturday when he used
          to collect the money. Our horse was named 'Henry' and was a gorgeous
          chestnut coloured animal who knew his own way round the round. I
          reckon if he could have picked the bottles up he could have done the
          job on his own! I remember we delivered all sizes of milk, quarts,
          pints (mostly), ½ pints, eggs cream and butter too. First thing in
          the morning I would go to the far end of West Wickham high street to
          the dairy where Henry was stabled. His cart would already be loaded
          with the quantities for delivery and I would fetch him from his
          stable to the cart, turn him round backwards, (difficult to do) and
          back him between the shafts. Then give him his nosebag and while he
          was tucking in, throw the harnesses over his back and lower the
          shafts and buckle him all up. A lovely farmyardy smell I recall. That
          took a little while, then by seven 'o clock we would be on our way.
          The cart would be very heavy to start with. There was no need to
          steer him as he knew his way. On the downhill parts the milkman would
          apply the brakes a little to save the cart pushing the horse faster
          than he could run!. Our round started at the bottom of Pickhurst
          Rise, and there were about 400 houses in that street. We would stop
          for lunch at the top in the Pickhurst Hotel. The horse would have his
          nosebag, the milkman a pint and a sandwich, I'd have an orange juice.
          Then we would carry on as far as The Avenue, The Chase and finally
          Goodhart way. We would be finished with an empty cart in the early
          afternoon. The milkman would flick the reigns and let me hold them.
          The horse knew his own way back to the stables and would clip clop
          happily all the way home pulling a much lightened cart.
