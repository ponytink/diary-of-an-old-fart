As I laid on the sunbed (in the shade) by the pool,  with a beer and reading my book, Valerie remarked that she had never seen me so relaxed. Well there was little else I could do stranded so far from home and with no computer, telephone or old ladies to visit! Anyway, it was a treat to sit quietly after the rush and tear of the past few days.<p />
We had been to so many places and seen so many things the mind was still boggling at the thought of it all. How would I remember all those facts the guides kept giving us. Old people are famous for short term memory loss and I am no exception! <b>The itinerary had been something like:-</b>
