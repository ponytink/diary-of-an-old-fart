      An introduction
    </h1>
    <hr>
    To my friends I am Tony Pink, officially born and christened Anthony Edgar
    Pink. I was born at 58 Rowden Road, Beckenham, Kent, just opposite Clock
    House Station and beside Cater Park, on a Tuesday Morning, 11th September
    1934 at 5.30 am ... Mum said I came with the Milkman. My dad told me about
    himself at odd times. I was always embarrassed by him singing 'Bless this
    House' or other pieces. He really enjoyed classical music, opera, football,
    cricket and other manly pursuits in all of which I seemed dreadfully
    lacking. His father, also Edgar, was a baker journeyman and for a hobby
    played euphonium in Croydon Silver Band. He died when my dad was only
    eleven. My dad lived at 78 Laurel Grove, Penge, SE20 . He went to work
    after only a very basic education. He told me he used to clean up and sweep
    hair from the floor of the gents hairdressers at Crystal Palace to get
    enough money to go skating.<br>
    <br>
    He had served in the first world war as a runner in the 10th Royal West
    Surrey Regt.. and was wounded somewhere in France. We have photographs
    showing him with other chaps 'convalescing on the Norfolk Broads. (Whilst
    looking at his medals I noticed Sid Makriel (my father in law) also had two
    medals which gave Sid's number and Regiment.... Pte Sidney Makriel 45743
    Rifle Brigade.)<br>

                After the first world war Edgar James became the publisher of
                the London Mercury. (Archie Veryard had all the copies my dad
                had. wrapped by the publisher in brown paper) This was a
                private publication to publicise the works of budding poets and
                unknown literary genius'. He worked directly for the owner, Sir
                John Squires, and later was employed at the Field and Queen at
                229 the Strand, which is why we have two water colours by T.S.
                Boys depicting the Strand from opposite directions, and which
                show his office.<br>
                <br>
                Before I was born he worked for a while in the depression of
                1926 driving a coach with tourists through the muck and bullets
                area of France (Frames Tours). Photo's supports this fact. He
                was then was out of work for two years before being employed
                by, first the Evening Standard and then, as I remember the
                Sunday Pictorial. (price 2d.)<br>
                <br>
                Auntie Pat Pratt, (Bert Canty's secretary) bought me an
                airforce blue suit with two pairs of trousers in which I was
                photographed wearing a paper hat and holding a wooden sword,
                and some other photographs were taken at the “Mirror” in a
                sailor suit sitting on my dad's lap or standing solo. He used
                to go to the races in Ostend with one Charlie Little (Liverpool
                &amp; Vic Insurance Man I believe) and when the second war
                broke out we were in Middlekirk, Belgium and only got home on
                the last boat to England from Zeebrugge.<br>
                <br>
                Dad went on to be the Chief London Sales Representative and
                worked in Central London throughout the war, often not coming
                home until Monday evening having gone to work on a Friday,
                although he went to work other days too, his main job kept him
                in London through the weekend. One such night he came to the
                end of Pickhurst Rise, where we lived, and was told that the
                street had been flattened and that he could not go in. He came
                home by various alley ways and back gardens and found us all
                OK. I remember going to school and walking round huge craters
                in the road with gas mains burning and people frying their
                breakfasts in frying pans over the burning flames down the
                crater because the gas indoors was not working. Also there was
                a pillar box up against a front door and letters all over the
                garden. Five years after the second war ended he found his job
                confining, and applied to be a wholesale newspaper distributor
                and secured the agency for Strood, succeeding the retiring Mrs
                Pierson at 93 High Street Strood in 1950. He soon won back some
                of the lost customers from Surridge Dawson. Moved from 93 High
                street to 49 Cuxton Road and then planned the new depot at
                Station Approach but died following an operation to remove a
                cancer in his colon in 1960 not seeing the rewards of his
                labours.<br>
                <br>
                I attended HAWSE DOWN Junior School with Miss Robinson being
                the Head teacher. No sooner had I started there war broke out,
                and I can vividly remember whilst my dad was at work, Mr
                Hayward from 113 coming over when the sirens sounded for a
                practice, and made us all get under the dining room table. We
                never hid under there again but dad moved the player piano
                adjacent to the main wall of the house and we slept on a
                mattress beside the piano if the bombing got heavy. Failing
                that, we stayed in our own beds. One night we were downstairs
                and a 500 lb bomb landed in old McDonald's back garden (No
                107). It used to be a picture of DIG for VICTORY !! The
                following morning we had a bath full of carrots, cabbage etc.,
                plus John's pillow had a bomb splinter through it right where
                his head would have been if he had slept there that night. That
                must have been the luckiest night of his life. A bomb splinter
                lodged itself in the spine of one of the copies of London
                Mercury, having passed clean through the wooden cupboard.<br>
                <br>
                Early on in the war we went to live with friends of Dad at
                Sandy Nr. Bedford, just for a week or two I believe. I remember
                shitting myself on the way to school as I was wearing a 'siren
                suit' and my dad had tried out on us for the first time ' SURE
                SHIELD LAXATIVES' - I can promise you they work !! After the
                Doodle-bugs which we all weathered, the V2 's caused our School
                to Evacuate to Skellow, Nr DONCASTER and I was there at 60
                Crossfield Lane with Bill and Betty YAPP and their son RAYMOND.
                Most of the kids came home within a week, but I stayed there
                about 10 months and came home after the VE Party to enjoy
                another one at the TOC 'H' Hall in West Wickham. I was the only
                one with a Yorkshire accent, and my dad now wore horn rimmed
                specs!! He drove a FORD PREFECT (Maroon) Reg No. FLY 409.<br>
                <br>
                I won a scholarship to the Beckenham &amp; Penge County School
                for Boys and had to make a new set of friends yet again. I used
                to travel to school on the 8.16 from West Wickham to Clock
                House, and meet my uncle 'Buller' (George William Bradley) at
                the next stop, Eden Park. He worked for London Transport. I
                must find out as what? He was very smartly dressed, rolled
                umbrella and all that! I was quite proud to be accepted there.
                On reflection I had a wonderful five years of Sea Cadet
                training, cricket and football after school and generally doing
                what boys do when growing up. I started in form 1d, and after
                that we were 'streamed' I went into 2G which stood for 'German'
                I stuck it for about a year, but Herr Doktor Liepman had zilch
                control over us and the class was often a shambles. - more of
                that later. I later transferred from 'G' to 'H' which was for
                handicrafts. I did both woodwork and metalwork, but by far
                favoured the woodwork. Mr Waterman was the kindly teacher, and
                only when severely stretched would he hurl the wooden black
                board cleaner at the offending child! I still find it useful to
                recall the correct method to use a marking gauge, or a chisel
                to cut a joint, not mention a spoke-shave!<br>
                <br>
                When we moved to Gillingham on May 1st 1950, I still had one
                term to conclude my schooling, and sit the School Certificate
                Examination. When I left school I thought I was going to have
                my summer holidays as usual, but Dad said Oh no! and I started
                work the following Monday. Six days a week for 25/=d. I had to
                give Mum a pound for my keep, which left just 5/=d for myself.
                Dad didn’t realise I smoked. He would have been livid if he had
                known! 10 Weight’s cost 10½d. So you could see my back was to
                the wall from the word go! However, the first day at work ended
                with me being taken off to hospital, and my appendix being
                removed at 7.30 the next morning. That in turn introduced me to
                Peter Griffin, and Jazz…… See Jazz Section
