<h1>Mysore and Ooty</h1><h2>Palace and Mountain Beauty</h2><hr /></center>  
Sunday 13th February, 2005.  -  This holiday is proving to be like a well written novel. - Every day it gets better and better! 
<p />
The Southern Star, Hassan was very comfortable. We left there at 8.00 am after a 7.00 am breakfast, again very adequate. Once at Belur we met our guide for the day.

The morning was spent visiting the temples at first, Belur the Chennakeshava temple which was built in 1117 ad.. and then later Halebid, where the Hoysaleshvara temple was built in 1121 ad. All those demons and Gods! Incredible is the only word to describe it all. Halebid was 19 miles from Hassan, where we had stayed the night, and Hassan was 137 miles from Bangalore from where we had started from at 8.00 am. the previous day. Our final destination today was Mysore which was 86 miles from Bangalore making a triangle with Hassan to the East, and Mysore to the South of Bangalore.<p />
As we drove from Halebid we passed people, chickens, motor bikes and tuk tuks, cows, goats, sheep and dogs just about everywhere. We even saw a cow entering a shop. I don't know what it was going to buy! For quite a distance we followed a truck with field workers in the back, and an old lady, presumably the mother of one of them. They all seemed very content with their bumpy ride. We passed fields of brightly coloured red and blue plants. Arun said they were medicinal herbs.<p/></tr></td>

We eventually arrived in Mysore. Another 3 star hotel, The Southern Star at Mysore was again of a very acceptable standard. Once checked in we had a beer, and Arun called back for us and took us to see the Maharaja's Palace. It was dusk and the palace was an absolutely unbelievable sight. Palacial of course, but with so much splendour. Hundreds of people mingling along the huge driveways, a band playing inside the enclosed area in front of the palace. The inevitable sellers of trinkets and postcards (just at the entrance - the guards kept them from bothering visitors -forceably once, I noticed!) - Marcelo had bought 4 flutes from a lad playing 'Frere Jacque' just to get rid of him!<p />

Presto! at seven 'o clock precisely a million or two lights were switched on. That must have caused some power surge! I knew it was to be illuminated, but I was expecting floodlighting. This was old fashioned 100 watt bulbs! What a spectacle. The story has it that on special occasions, and every Sunday the Maharaja would come out to the terrace and as he sat, his favourite elephant 'Rajenta' would throw him a rosette of flowers. Simultaneously the lights would come on. (He gave the job up in 1942). The same elephant, used to carry a solid gold throne which weighed 700 kilos! and in it, carried the Maharaja,  his wife and son.

Here you can see 'old baldy' with Arun admiring the spectacle of one side of Mysore Palace all lit up on a Sunday evening at 7.00 pm, or dusk, whenever that may occur. Tomorrow morning we will return and be shown round part of the palace, and afterwards visit the local vegetable market. - a mind blowing day ahead I am sure!

The next morning, Monday February 14th., we met the guide and left to see the forts where the Tipu Sultan made his last stand against the British, and visited his tomb in splendid garden surroundings.  From there we went on to visit a bird sanctuary where we saw loads of herons storks and what have you. Not far from the sanctuary we stopped at a delightful restaurant called 'The Olive Garden'  and enjoyed an excellent lunch. I had the local lamb curry, which in the event proved hotter than I expected. - I didn't find out until the morning!

<td><h2>A TIP FOR LONGEVITY</h2>
People say that you can't make a living from birdwatching. That is perhaps
true, but it is also true that man does not live by bread alone. Just look
at the people who have no such hobbies and spend all their time solely in
earning a living. After 50, when they retire from official chair warming
they don't know what to do with all the time in their hands and just spend
it watching the clock! If they had cultivated a hobby like birdwatching -
remember it is very health giving because you have to be out of doors to
watch birds - they would have lived longer to enjoy their pension. <br>
