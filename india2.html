          As the flight progressed I noticed from my window on the port side,
          probably 60 or 70 windmill generators running along the top of what
          appeared to be a small mountain range. It would seem they were taking
          advantage of the elements where ever possible. As we descended into
          Bangalore I was quite surprised by the vastness of the metropolis
          below me. We were later told that Bangalore was one of the fastest
          growing economic areas in India. Their version of Silicon Valley.
          10,000 people a year moving to the area, and that there were at the
          last count 110,000 tuk tuks (the little three wheel taxis) in
          Bangalore alone.After an amazing journey from the airport with our
          new driver for the week, Arun, we arrived unscathed at the Monarch
          Hotel. The traffic was horrendous as it must have been chucking out
          time for the workers. Tuk tuks and mopeds everywhere. At the time I
          noted that Arun was an excellent driver, even better that myself,
          which is quite an admission! He was to uphold that standard
          throughout the week. At this hotel, and the others in the week that
          followed, we only had bed and breakfast provided. Would could eat in
          the hotel, or dine out, just as we pleased. Belinda had work to do in
          her capacity of Health and Safety Inspector and said she would be off
          for about two hours, how about looking around the town, and meeting
          at the main cross roads and eating in a restaurant. That agreed, we
          set of on a reccy of the main street. Reminiscent of Chatham High
          Street in it's hey day, there was every kind of shop imaginable. One,
          like Millet's selling just about everything was built over four or
          five stories with escalators that were not in working order, so you
          had to climb to each floor. If you hadn't done it, you would never
          believe such places existed!At 7.30 we met up with Belinda and
          elected to try the Haida restaurant with a North Indian cuisine. Very
          sumptuous, and well staffed. We were shown to seats and given menus.
          We all ordered a drink and studied the menu. I elected no starters,
          but a main course. The others all had starters and I helped with a
          little of each. By that time I was full! I had ordered the chef's
          special chicken which was gi-normous (and very nice indeed) I was
          very sorry not to have been able to finish it. The others were
          similarly beaten. We had coffees and another little drink, and the
          bill came to 1,240 IRPs - about £14.78 for the four of us.

            Onwards to Hassan
          </h2>
          <hr>
          12th February. Our guide, Chindra met us in reception at 8.00am and
          we set off for the 'Bull Temple' in Bangalore. It would seem that the
          farmers worship the bull, and offer him groundnuts at harvest time in
          return for which he (the bull) .... - I forget! but you will find it
          documented elsewhere when I dig it up again.The Bull, of which this
          is the fourth largest in India, is carved from one solid piece of
          granite in situe and polished like glass, and is decorated with
          garlands, tended with utmost care by several barefooted monks in
          doties. Quite a spectacle.From there we moved on to the botanic
          gardens until 10.00 am then made tracks for Hassan and the temple
          there. At 10.20 we came across a traffic jam and in the middle of all
          the mayhem there was a little girl barefooted, in a lovely colourful
          dress nipping in and out of the traffic begging for coins. She could
          only have been about 9 or 10. So pretty, and so happy. Everyone
          seemed to be giving her something. We each dug down and found a rupee
          or two and passed them out of the window. - She beamed!As we
          continued through the countryside I noted a mud hut with a satellite
          dish in the garden! and another gentleman watering the dusty porch
          way to his abode, which he was then brushing into a smooth paste, no
          doubt very proud of the entrance to what could only be described as a
          hovel, but of course to him, home.Then, in the middle of nowhere we
          came across a gang of about 6 or 7 women threshing wheat in the
          middle of the main road. We had to drive through and over their
          handiwork giving the customary toot toot! - Un-believable! Then we
          overtook a gang of kids with huge smiles on their way to school, or
          to work in the fields. I am not sure which, but I suspect school.
          They looked so happy and pleased to wave to us. (I did feel very
          white). At one point I asked Arun, our driver to stop so I could
          photograph two carts each pulled by a pair of oxen. A typical sight.
          Eventually some 200 kms on, we arrived at our next hotel. The
          Southern Star at Hassan. It was the only building of note in a street
          of lock ups and sheds, but never the less. Very comfortable and the
          bar and food really excellent. Marcelo ordered a 'screwdriver' and
          Valerie a Pina Princess (non alcoholic) while I had a Kingfisher. AT
          39 RPs a litre bottle one could not possibly complain. Along with
          that came a basket with spicy popadoms and coated peanuts (chilli
          coated, much to Marcelo's disgust). As we had stopped for lunch on
          the way, we elected only to order starters. Valerie had cauliflower
          in batter, and paneer sag which was very tasty. I had ½ tandoori
          chicken which was just as you would expect, and Marcelo had the
          chicken tikkas. Marcelo tried the wine (red) and declared it sweet
          and that it should be chilled, and asked for an ice bucket and some
          water. Water? the waiter queried. Yes, Marcelo said, and showed him
          how sweet wine should be chilled before drinking, whether it was red
          or white. - That's what we all like about Marcelo - He's so correct.
          and is every time! - The bill with coffee:- 250 RPs each (about
          £3.00)Then to bed about 10.30. Tomorrow breakfast at 7.00 am and
          leaving at 8.00 for Mysore. Is this a holiday or what? !! <a href=
