              From Pet Basic to CPM and MSDOS and More
            </h2><br>
            Having befriended Colin Webster from the computer club he was far
            more advanced than I in the machine code dept. (6502 processor) -
            He wrote for me a "Print using"###.##" routine which was sadly
            lacking from Pet Basic. It worked like a dream! Paul then helped me
            write a routine that dealt with the cursor movements.<br>
            <br>
            After a while the Sirius Machine came on the market at around
            £1,200. for a twin floppy version. Paul had started up in business
            on his own under the banner C&amp;E Microtonics and was an agent
            for ACT who marketed the machine in this country. I ordered one
            seeing it as a great improvement from the pet.<br>
            <br>
            I had been approached by both Mr Bondi of Gravesend and Cox from
            Eastbourne to see if it were possible to write a news invoicing
            program. With Paul's help, we jointly looked into the problem(s) -
            There were many, and from the outset I decided that if you could
            not update a customer's order data at conversational speed, then it
            was a non starter. The next step forward was the acquisition of a
            10mb hard drive which performed a lot faster than the twin floppy
            machine. It was not until the Fab86 fast access indexing system was
            discovered by Paul that the job at last became a runner.<br>
            <br>
            . Bondi decided to go ahead and helped draft the requirements for
            his news invoicing system. Paul had quoted him £4,000 plus the hard
            drive machine would cost around £2,800 and of course he needed a
            printer too. The whole job took a year and was very successful. It
            was written originally in GWbasic (I think) then converted to
            Qbasic and compiled with Bascom. The suite was named Newsys and we
            had hopes of selling multiple copies. I took the system to the Isle
            of Wight and did a spectacular demonstration where the Man from
            Software House selling to the Wholesaler there ran his elbow all
            over the keyboard while the invoices were printing. Due to Paul's
            competent programming skills, the invoice run continued without a
            hitch. I learnt more from Paul than from anywhere else during my
            time playing/working with computers.<br>
            <br>
            Following an enquiry from 'Payne of Margate' I arranged a
            spectacular demonstration whereby he sent me a copy of one of his
            customer's invoices with all the pricing blanked out. I then
            enetered the customer into our system and produced an invoice for
            the same quantities and naturally there were differences.<br>
            <br>

            I arranged to meet up with Bert Goatham to compare the differences
            and validate the accuracy of our program. (Naturally it won hands
            down!) his main errors, and there were several I have to say, were
            in the cross adding of the quires across the six days of the week.
            Of course the use of a computer to store the customer and order
            data completely did away for the need of any calculations, and the
            invoices were produced, very neatly may I say, at the touch of a
            button. - A revolution at that time!<br>

            Later, with Ed Frost we all trouped to Menzies in Edinburgh to give
            a demonstration there. A long day out. The demonstration was very
            well received, but not sold. I think they were just after ideas!
            One point they raised was the question of 13/12 and returns - i.e.
            if a customer took 15 copies, entitling him to a free copy, but he
            returned 4 - how many would we credit? I had to confess I had not
            considered that aspect of the returns and would give the matter
            further thought.<br>

            <h2>
              Peter and Sheila Bird
            </h2>Having obtained no further orders for the 'NEWSYS' program as
            it stood, when Paul was asked by Sheila and Peter Bird from
            Ramsgate to drastically alter the system to suit their requirement,
            Paul decided to let me do the necessary 'tailoring' If that's what
            it could be called! He completely re-wrote an entirely new set of
            programs which needed debugging and tickling to suit the customer.
            True to form I would pitch in and work until something like a
            solution would emerge in the early hours , driving home well after
            midnight on many occasions.<br>
            <br>
            The main side benefit was the fact that Sheila was an extremely
            competent cook, and I often got to sample some exciting goodies. On
            the flip side, they had a dog who's name escapes me at the moment,
            but her bed was situate beneath the computer station, and she took
            a dislike to me from the word go! or at least the fact I wanted to
            put my ankles in the vicinity of her bed. - There is a lot more to
            this computer lark than at first meets the eye!
