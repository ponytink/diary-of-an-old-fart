      This must have been one of the happiest periods of my life! I moved up into the Senior school, still ST.
      JOHNS school attached to the local church of the same name. This
      establishment was a cut above the other elementary schools in the
      district. We had to have a uniform, black and white caps, black blazer
      with white trim, grey shirts, black and white tie, grey sock with black
      and white trim also. It was a fine school with lots of tradition and it
      left a mark on me throughout my life, specially where sport is
      concerned."WHEN THE MAN UP THERE COMES TO MARK YOUR CARD, HE MATTERS NOT
      IF YOU WON OR LOST, BUT HOW YOU PLAYED THE GAME.! or words to that effect
      were the keystone of the school's sports philosophy! Schools always have
      rivals, and ours was OAKFIELD! T77here also was a Senior Catholic School
      in the district plus the ANERLEY RESIDENTIAL which was an orphanage and
      interestingly a large Deaf and Dumb school we used to compete against in
      all sports, but Oakfield was our main rivals akin to Oxford and
      Cambridge! My dear Mother after years of loving care and devotion had
      nursed me to the stage where I was now ready to take part in all the
      sports that the school could offer. Though thinking back, she must have
      had her heart in her mouth when first I ventured out onto the playing
      fields! I soon found out that I had a natural aptitude for any ball game
      and found my niche in the school soccer and cricket teams. This was
      indeed an incredible time for me after being bed ridden for so many years
      and I put my heart and soul into every aspect of the games. My soccer
      teachers were a Mr.McCloud and Northcote and they must have done a good
      job with me as soon I was picked for the District side, Beckenham and
      Penge. This indeed was a great honour and life was a breeze for me. I
      played at center forward. Around this time I entered the school
      athletics, won the 100 &amp; 200 yards which took me onto the District
      sports which I also won then onto the Kent County Sports where once again
      I won. Now came the biggest honour! Running in the all England Athletics
      event at Preston Park, Brighton! I must point out here, that by now, my
      Father had passed away and in those days when the wage earner went, you
      were really down the pan! No welfare State as today, food coupons if you
      were lucky and didn't mind the indignity of taking them to the shop! My
      Mum was so proud and only later did I realise the struggle she had to
      help me in this venture. The big day came and you can imagine my horror
      when I found I was the only boy with no spikes! Well I managed to get
      through the heats to the semi final but sadly failed to qualify for the
      final. It was a great day, which will live with me forever. The other
      highlight in the school years was the last one. Our school had reached
      its centurion, 100 years and its role of honour was indeed very
      impressive. Sadly, as the school held a prime position on the main cross
      road in town, it was decided to terminate it.,Move to the Beckenham
      Grammar school just down the road and build the new Grammar school in
      Eden Park but before the demise of the old place we were in the Cup Final
      against our rivals OAKFIELD SCHOOL in the 100th year of the school and
      the last year of its life! Well this is a fairy story indeed, It was a
      very tough match with no quarter given, 0-0 at halftime and I scored the
      winning goal near the end, I broke clear, used my speed and scored with a
      glorious left foot as the goalie came out to meet me! What a Day! I still
      have the picture of me being chaired on the team's shoulders holding the
      cup! A picture I cherish to this day! Cricket was also a great part of my
      life, my teacher in my senior class was a Mr. Yeoman who happened to be a
      real cricket nut and played for Surrey second team. I never shone at the
      game but became an excellent fielder usually at first slip or silly mid
      on. However I did learn the game and all its allure of being a real
      sporting game with all the tradition and demanding technique and it is
      sad to see the way the game is developing today. One thing we were taught
      at St John's was never to boast, so hopefully I have not erred in my
      account of my Sports life at school! Academically I was never a front
      runner, just average, maths was always a mystery, Algebra was a lost
      cause but I loved reading and writing. We had a very heavy work load here
      as we learnt French, typewriting, shorthand, book keeping etc on top all
      the other subjects, and of course, being a church School we had more than
      our fair share of Religion. In fact when Captain of the school it was my
      onerous task to deliver the morning sermon on some days at assembly.<br>
      Comes 1937, I was 14 in April, time to leave school, those days we were
      all in short trousers, Jeans were not even invented! My Brother in Law,
      married to my eldest sister Frances (MOGGY), worked on the Newspapers in
      some executive position, and had used his influence to procure me a job
      as messenger boy on the "DAILY MIRROR"  So I departed from St John's with
      heavy heart but very happy memories of my school years. It is hard to
      convey to people in words, the hard times we were all living in. It was
      still the depression years. Jobs were scarce. Money was extremely tight,
      millions on the dole, men fighting for jobs, most women had to leave work
      when they married so were tied to the home, some fortunate to get a few
      hours a week cleaning as my mum was able to do. My two sisters had now
      married and had flown the nest leaving my brother Ben 10 years older than
      me to keep the home going. Ben was more out of work than in, he had
      numerous jobs but nothing steady except some butchering jobs. Most people
      worked from week to week and it was only the women who scoured the
      markets for cheap cuts of meat and veg that made life bearable. There
      were the horrible days when you didn't have the rent or insurance money
      and hid behind the curtains and didn't answer the door! Clothes were
      always a problem and it usually meant having a "TALLY MAN" calling round
      every week for a few coppers!<br></font>

      <font face="Arial" color="black" size="2">So now a new period was
      starting in my life. Into the big world, first problem was fitting me out
      for work! Very little money, needed clothes for work, money for fares to
      London etc, the problem did not worry me, I was obviously oblivious at
      the time to the many problems this must have given my Mum, but like the
      Angel she was, she came through for her little "BLOSSOM! as she was prone
      to call me! With the aid of a pair of my brother-in law's trousers I was
      ready to take on the world!  I traveled by train from Penge East to
      Blackfriars station in the city and made my way to FETTER LANE off of
      Fleet St. where the large and imposing building of the Daily Mirror and
      Sunday Pictorial were based.<br>
      With heart pounding I made myself known to the very officious looking man
      at the front desk who I remember looked me up and down, sniffed, called a
      boy about a foot shorter than me and told him to take me to MR MARTIN in
      the TAPE ROOM. MR MARTIN! How that name brings fear to me even now when I
      hear it! He was an absolute ogre! A very ugly man with the most obnoxious
      manner you could imagine. He must have been a very unhappy man because I
      never ever saw him smile! He took my name etc, then said to one of a few
      boys that were sitting in the room. "TAKE HIM DOWN TO THE TAPE ROOM AND
      SHOW HIM WHAT TO DO, IF HE MAKES A MESS OF IT BRING HIM BACK HERE!" With
      sinking heart I followed this boy down numerous corridors and entered a
      long narrow room with about 6 Tape Machines printing away like merry
      hell, this narrow room was shut off from a very large room by a glass
      partition. Looking through the glass I could see many desks with multiple
      phones and very imposing men all sitting there. The boy with me then
      proceed to explain my duties, as each machine that was printing news
      stories from different News Agencies, REUTERS etc. were pumping out pages
      of the latest news happenings, I had to tear them off making sure I kept
      them in numerical order. pass through a small door and place them on the
      desk of THE COPY TASTER whose name I remember only too well! MR POSTLE-
      WAITE! His job, was to sort through the copy, and pass on to the NEWS
      EDITOR any items he thought were relevant. The only problem was, I
      happened to be, to my misfortune, an avid reader and proceeded to read
      everything I took off the machine before giving it to Mr. POSTLEWAITE! He
      tapped on the window and with a wicked crooked finger beckoned me to him.
      He then proceeded to give me a dressing down like I had never
      experienced! I left him with tears in my eyes but it was a long time
      before I ever read one of those stories again<br>
      I soon got into the swing of things, and it was such an exciting time and
      place to be at 14 years of age! Here I was in the NEWSROOM of the biggest
      Newspaper in the world! All these people I was working with or rather
      for, were the top people in their field, somewhat like the T.V.
      celebrities today. There was the excitement, hustle and bustle when a big
      story broke, phones ringing by the dozen, people running about like mad
      men, just like you see on the movies when they are filming a Newspaper
      office. So life was pretty good. Amazingly we did shift work up until
      10p.m. so it was quite exciting being in the city at that time of night
      for a 14 year old. Not so funny starting at 6a.m.!<br>
      Soon I was relieved of my tedious job as it was very stressful, no
      breaks, if they were short of boys, sometimes no lunch! No one to care
      for you, so you became a bit hard and very resourceful! Now I had to take
      a turn as "BOY" in the NEWSROOM! This indeed was a dream.. I thought!
      Here I was to quickly learn that "BOY" was the lowest form of human life!
      At everyone's beck and call! Boy! do this BOY take this BOY! get me this!
      As there were about 20 men NEVER ONE FEMALE in the room, the task in
      keeping all this under control was mind bending, if I was sent to the
      library for cuttings or photos downstairs I used to jump 6 steps at a
      time! Then I was taken upstairs to meet one of the famous writers of the
      day! None other than MR GODFREY WINN! If I had known then what I know now
      I would have been very wary of him I can tell you. It pleased my ego when
      I was introduced to him as a very smart and speedy boy! By this time of
      course with my wages of twelve and six a week I was able to dress myself
      a little better! Well I was to become Godfrey's personal messenger! He
      had run an appeal for toys for poor children for the coming Xmas and
      people all over London were donating all sorts of stuff to be collected.
      This obviously was a big publicity do for the paper so they went for it
      in a big way. Depending on what they were donating etc I could take a
      TAXI back to the office once I had collected them. It is amazing looking
      back, no one ever gave us any lessons on the layout of London, not even a
      map. I think that is why I talk a lot and ask hundreds of questions of
      people much to Jean's chagrin! You were on your own and had to get by! I
      soon learned how to earn a few bob. I bought an old bike from one of the
      kids and kept it locked up and hidden close to the office. I would be
      given so much money to cover the approximate taxi fare etc plus the
      address and phone number of the place I had to find. First thing on
      leaving the office I used to phone the people concerned if they had one;
      and if I found that the said items I had to collect were easily attached
      to my bike, so be it and I kept the fare. Sometimes I had to collect 2 or
      3 items at adjacent houses so this was not possible. I did find a few
      times that on going by my bike to pick up something, then the people
      found they had more than they thought, so I was landed with putting the
      bike on the taxi as well which cost me more! But overall I was doing
      pretty good and was able to make Mum's life a bit easier. I did manage to
      have a social life outside of work. I played soccer for a mens' team run
      by my other brother-in -law Ted, married to my youngest sister Winnie.
      This was when I was not working for the SUNDAY PICTORIAL which worked on
      the Saturday for publishing on the Sunday. I also managed to play cricket
      on the Sundays that I was off duty.<br>
      This period in my life was quite exciting, working in the newsroom of the
      biggest selling paper in the world. It is hard to convey in words the
      daily thrill of being at the very hub of the big news stories of the day.
      Remember all this was prior to the modern day electronics explosion where
      every thing is instant! Those days, speed was all-important to catch the
      deadline for going to press! In this period, no expense was spared to
      beat the competition, which in those days was fierce, as there were many
      more morning papers than at present. To this end, photographers would
      sometimes take one of us boys with them to speedily carry the photos
      (NEGATIVES) back to the office, sometimes sporting events. Other times
      big events of the day. You can perhaps understand how this was very
      exciting for a 14 year old?<br>
      By this time I had really come to terms with the harsh way everyone
      treated us boys. Verbal abuse was the order of the day and we had our own
      way of dealing with this as we were responsible for providing their tea
      and food, sandwiches etc. This little operation I will leave to your
      imagination! One little operation I remember well as it put many a bob
      into the Hussey coffers! There were two very famous sandwich bars in
      Fetter Lane, SHORTLANDS where there were no seats. Everyone stood at
      counters. Men busily cutting and preparing all sorts of wonderful
      sandwiches, liver sausage being one of the most favoured! These were
      quite expensive, as were the ones from the pub on the corner whose name
      evades me for the moment. Right opposite the Mirror was a wonderful
      Italian café, which I personally used and because I frequented it a lot,
      I happily got well looked after when partaking of the odd bacon buttie! I
      suggested a scheme to LUIGI the owner, whereby I would manage to get some
      bags from the aforementioned establishments, this was easy because when
      busy they used to give us boys the sandwiches on a plate and some bags to
      put them in. I suggested he could make the sandwiches exactly as they
      did, charge the office people the regular prices and we could split the
      difference! It worked like a dream and never once did anyone suspect!
      Then we found a shop that would give us a discount on cigarettes!
      Everyone in the office smoked like a kipper! The pressure everyone worked
      under was unbelievable! The do-gooders today would have a field day
      though their lives would have been short lived I can tell you! SO with
      these and many other little scams we boys did very well thank you! 16
      years of age. Promotion! Now I was to leave the ranks of the downtrodden
      abused ranks of the messenger boys! I was to move into the ART ROOM. This
      was included in the Main NEWSROOM, our staff consisted of THE ART EDITOR
      and 1st assistant and 4 caption writers for the pictures. My duties were
      to empty the chutes, this was a device for sending things in a round
      cylinder up or down a chute direct into the office. One came from the
      main door where the photo agencies used to leave photos of all the events
      of the day, plus photos of celebrities, sporting or theatrical etc. I had
      to take the photos out, smooth them and give them to the Art Editor,
      making sure I NEVER INTERRUPTED him in any shape or form. The Art editor
      would be in constant conference with the Chief Sub Editor in the room
      next door which was open to the Newsroom. This was really necessary
      because he needed to know how much space he was allowed for the photo
      going with the news story. The art editor had a large squared pad in
      front of him which was the size of the paper opened up, this was divided
      in eighth of an inch squares. The middle page was called the Spread and
      consisted mainly of photos and was usually prepared in the morning
      leaving the main photos to go in the news pages, as and when the latest
      stories broke. So now the Art Editor would be gradually forming his plan
      of every page. He gradually began to form a plan of each page, where the
      photos should go, how big they should be, how much room the Caption
      Writer would have to make a topical and if possible, funny and apt
      comment. This was done under extreme pressure of time, depending on the
      amount of space and type chosen. This left them having to write something
      tangible, apt &amp; humorous, yet telling the story of the photo! This
      meant having to find the correct amount of words that would fit into the
      space allowed in the type-face chosen. Now perhaps you can get an idea of
      the immense pressure that all these people lived under and why they
      smoked and drank to excess! Sometime during the morning, the Editor would
      finish the spread, he would then give it to me to copy, this was done on
      a long oblong glass topped cabinet lit from inside, this enabled me to
      copy it. The original was sent upstairs to the COMPOSING room to the man
      working on the STONE. In the meantime, the photographs with instructions
      for processing written on them with a red Chinagraph pencil were sent via
      the aforementioned chute to the PROCESSING DEPT. Here they would make a
      plate and send it down to the man on the Stone who would be working on
      the center Spread. At the same time they would send me down UNDERLAYS of
      the plates they had made from the photos. These were rough copies of the
      said photos. These I would cut out and stick onto my copy of the Spread,
      so gradually I produced an exact copy of the page the Editor had planned
      and he could see at a glance if he needed to alter positions, size
      etc.<br>
      An item of interest for you is how and why he had to mark the photos for
      size, depending on the space allowed him, say 2 column widths,(4 and half
      inches,) he would draw a line from top left corner to bottom right
      corner, take a ruler, from the edge of the photo required, find the spot
      where that measurement met the red line, mark it, measure from there down
      and this would be the length of the picture when condensed., So now he
      could draw those measurements onto the page and so on. My duties also
      called for me to dash to the library for pictures and cuttings of people
      or events that they were working on. If a big story broke, a murder, big
      scandal, International crisis or anything that was a bit sensational, all
      Hell broke loose, phones going like the clappers, hollering and hooting,
      visits from the CHIEF EDITOR who was like a God, total chaos. This was
      all part and parcel of life in the NEWSROOM. I hope I have conveyed a
      little of the wonderful, exciting atmosphere it was to work in.  It seems
      unbelievable in this day and age with teenagers mollycoddled into manhood
      that we actually did shift work in those days and if there was an
      emergency we were known to be kept there until the paper went to
      bed!

      WAR!<br></font>
    </center>
    <p align="left">
      <font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><br>
      I was now 16 and 4 months old. It was as if someone had pulled a switch!
      Our lives changed so dramatically! Although there had been millions of
      words written and spoken leading up to this day, very few people
      including the Government I might add, actually expected it to happen.
      Panic was the order of the day! Mobilisation, conscription etc had been
      lumbering along in a very muddled happy go lucky manner. Paper by the
      millions of tons was being thrown at us with Propaganda, advice from all
      the various Ministries, i.e. Power, Food, Housing, Transport, Industry,
      Then mobilisation (AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS) etc. came into its own, Gas
      Masks were issued with dire results if caught without one! People changed
      too. We had lived so long in a dull routine sort of fashion with very
      little excitement to our lives, remember very few people had a radio of
      any quality, we had no electricity, only gas! Rationing of everything one
      needed was strictly enforced! So now not only were we kept from the nice
      things in life by lack of money, now we had to suffer even worse
      shortages!<br>
            The horrors of war were soon brought home to us when we heard that
      the local TERRITORIAL UNIT OF THE ROYAL WEST KENTS had been decimated in
      their first encounter with the mighty Panzer Divisions of THE HUN! These
      were lovely young local lads who I had known and played sport with, they
      had joined up for a bit of a lark and to get a fortnight away from home
      for two weeks camp a year. Knowing now what I know about the war and what
      they were sent into, I could cry and condemn the politicians whose
      negligence sent them to this horror, it was like lambs to the slaughter.
      Daily we were reading the casualty list from France and we began to
      realise pretty quickly that the war was really on and not just a passing
      phase. The air raids then started! Everyone had an ANDERSON SHELTER in
      their small back garden, these were made of corrugated iron and sunk into
      the ground and then earth shoveled on top. This is where most people
      spent their nights when the raids started, living down there in the damp
      cramped condition listening with bating breath as the planes approached.
      Everyone became an expert at noises, differentiating between British
      planes and German, waiting for the scream of the bombs as they hurtled
      down, judging where they were going to drop! Close ones would be
      accompanied by the violent shaking of the ground around you plus the
      sounds of buildings collapsing and the cries of the wounded etc.<br>
             Around this time I joined the L.D.V. LOCAL DEFENCE VOLUNTEERS.
      This was situated at the local Drill Hall. It was a real laugh when
      recalling it now! A ragged assortment of old men and young boys, no
      uniforms, just an arm band! A local butcher in the market named GALLEY,
      was made a Captain and one or two old sweats from the first war took
      charge and attempted to drill us into some form of order. We had no
      weapons only Indian clubs borrowed from a local school, by this time the
      bombing was reaching crisis stage. Damage to buildings and services very
      serious. It was deemed necessary to be on duty during the night as most
      raids took place then. We were paid subsistence money for this and
      looking back, us kids must have thought it was a bit of a lark.
      Eventually we received uniforms. These were of cotton drill based on the
      regular Battledress, now we were beginning to look like soldiers, our
      drill improved and we were able to march to Church Parade, all shapes and
      sizes but managing to inspire the local inhabitants if not the German
      Panzer Divisions! The war seemed to drag on with lack of any good news,
      the U Boats were taking a heavy toll at sea causing terrible shortages of
      food and supplies etc. France fell with the poor old BRITISH
      EXPEDITIONARY FORCES being chased out of DUNKIRK. Our house suffered
      heavy damage from a huge bomb falling across the road, now impossible to
      use the top floor! House had to be shored up!.  No water! No gas! Had to
      use standpipes at corner of the road, no coal to use the fire! Could only
      get 14lb. of coal at a time for 4 pence!  This enabled us to cook a meal
      but there were local community kitchens that used to serve soup,
      dehydrated meat powdered potatoes and rice. Sugar and tea were the
      hardest to obtain and eggs were like gold dust! Sitting here in 2000, it
      is hard to be accurate into the exact chronicle of events, so please bear
      with me, around this time, my eldest sister Frances (Moggy) was expecting
      her second born (John). Her husband, EDGAR, who worked on the Newspapers
      suggested, as our house was almost uninhabitable, we move to their house
      in West Wickham. This we did. It was a nice modern house in PICKHURST
      RISE. This was fine for a while as it was more comfort for mum and also a
      help for my sister. We were only  a stones throw from the famous BIGGIN
      HILL FIGHTER STATION and were soon to find out to our dismay, that as the
      Germans started their daylight raids on London the fighters would take
      off from Biggin Hill to intercept them and the battles took place right
      above us in broad daylight. Naturally many of the bombers when hit,
      immediately jettisoned their bombs causing havoc to the peaceful
      community of West Wickham ! So much for being safer! Only relief for me
      was, still working on the Daily Mirror and Edgar working on the Sunday
      Pictorial, I was often able to get a lift to work when my shifts
      coincided with his work schedule. So life went on, when possible, I was
      still doing my stint at the drill hall with the L.D.V. soon to become the
      HOME GUARD! We actually got weapons and clips of ammo.  The rifles were
      Springfield with an aperture sight complete with bayonets. Now we looked
      the business, we were often deployed around the district where bomb
      damage had caused shops and dwellings etc to be laid bare to the chance
      looters etc. There were many incidents, too many to impart here but one
      that comes to mind that was quite serious at the time. Remember we were
      expecting to be invaded at any time of day and with this scenario you can
      imagine the rumours that were abound! One night of spasmodic bombing that
      seemed to miss us and was delivered to the docks in central London. We
      had got the all clear and had got our heads down for a couple of hours
      when we were rudely awakened with the ALARM!!! PARACHUTISTS HAD LANDED IN
      THE GROUNDS OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE!!! Well! All Hell let loose, talk about
      organised chaos! Men and equipment flying everywhere, out of this
      shambles we gathered about 30 of us armed to the teeth, young boys and
      old men loaded down with every conceivable piece of equipment and off we
      went the short distance to the Palace. We soon realised how little we
      knew about deploying Infantry over ground with so much cover. Every
      movement and shadow was intensified to our untrained eyes and ears, and
      after many frustrating and nerve racking moments, it was discovered that
      some over eager watchdog had mistaken the many Italian statues in the
      Italian gardens on the raised terraces for our so called Parachutists! So
      ended our first call to arms! By this time most of my close friends being
      older had been called up, I did manage to get myself a very nice girl for
      company though. Her name was ROSALIND JONES. She lived with her mother
      and sister in Ridsdale Road. When possible we went to the cinema with
      H.P. Sauce sandwiches, and spent many a happy hour in the Air Raid
      shelters. Now I was nearly 18. Still working on the Daily Mirror, and one
      day I had a rush of blood to the head, chucked my job in and went to join
      the Army! OF COURSE IT WAS COMPLETE MADNESS TO HAVE DONE SUCH A FOOLHARDY
      STUNT! The Army would not take me because of my age and now I was out of
      a job! The Labour exchange put me on BOMB DAMAGE work, which was very
      tough and intensive, but the money was very good and I was able to help
      Mum a lot. Then one of the guys in the Home Guard asked if I would like a
      job with a friend of his who was a lift fitter as his mate? I said sure
      as the work on the bomb damage was really very tough. So off I go
      Rosehill  Carshalton  Hospital where I met my lift fitter, Tich Freeman.
      He was a real nice guy and a real craftsman. We were to fit two big lifts
      into this hospital and it was an eye opener to the skills this guy had.
      Soon we had the job finished and moved to another job at Guys Hospital
      and after a short time the Army called for me.<br>
             Naturally, this was a big shock to my Mother, but being Mum, she
      never tried to dissuade me. I had opted to join the Infantry (my biggest
      mistake!) and chose a Kent Regiment, THE BUFFS. So off I went to
      Canterbury, to the depot of the Buffs, on the train I met Charlie Kaufman
      whose father kept the egg shop in the Maple road market.<br>
                He was rejoining his unit somewhere on the south coast and
      spent the journey giving me plenty of advice about my first few days.
      Like most boys of that age I was cocky and thought I knew it all. After
      all, I had been in the Home Guard. I knew my drill I was good with a
      rifle. A good marksman, I could look smart and could look the part so I
      wasn't expecting too many problems. (Second big mistake!) Found the Depot
      O.K. a huge spread of decaying Victorian buildings surrounding a very
      menacing square with various squads being yelled at in fierce tones by
      menacing figures soon to become familiar to us all. A Sgt.Greenslade, a
      regular soldier, greeted us. After a short message of welcome he took us
      around various huts to pick up our uniforms and equipment. Soon we were
      laden down with more than we could handle, Shown the hut that would be
      our home for the next few weeks, told to dump our stuff on our beds,
      outside, then marched to the dining room for our evening meal. This
      indeed was an education! The noise and clatter was inconceivable! We were
      seated 12 to a table, an orderly appeared and gave the man at end of the
      table a dish and was told to get in the queue for the meal. This he did
      and reappeared with a big dish of cheese and potato pie! A big slice of
      bread and butter for each was also provided, we had been issued with our
      fighting irons (knife fork spoon) Now the man who got the meal had to
      share it out. At this stage we were complete strangers so lots of decorum
      and politeness abounded, soon to disappear unfortunately into basic
      animal instincts of survival!<br>
             The thing that amazed me was how quick we had to do things! It
      didn't seem as if we had time to blow our nose and we had another order
      that demanded instant attention. N.C.Os came to our hut to show us how to
      make our beds with the blankets, how to store our kit etc, how to polish
      our boots, clean our weapons, learn the different bugle calls that
      organised our day and night activities etc. Out of all this chaos we soon
      realised we had a real tough time ahead! They even issued us with a
      HOUSEWIFE! This was a small cotton form of envelope complete with
      needles, thimble, cotton and grey wool for darning socks! Quite a sight
      to see 12 teenage boys sitting down trying to thread a needle and cotton,
      but it had to be done! The most alarming thing about all this was the
      timing! Everything seemed timed to the minute! No time for mistakes. Do
      It, and do it right now!! We seemed to be forever changing out of one set
      of clothes to another for different exercises. P.T. Rifle Drill, Marching
      drill, fatigues etc. etc. Reveille at 6 o'clock was a real shaker! When
      we heard the first strains of the bugler, sounding reveille, we had to be
      up, as the Sgt. would be standing inside the door. Then with soap and
      towel we were off to the Ablutions that were in the open with just a
      cover, lukewarm water if we were lucky, then dress and parade for
      breakfast inspection, hands, nails &amp; hair closely inspected then
      marched off to breakfast.<br>
             Then came room inspection! What a performance! Everything set to a
      pattern with not a thing out of place, everything shining, blankets
      measured to conform to size, every single item of equipment was inspected
      minutely right down to the lace holes in our boots that had to be shiny!
      Of course many of us didn't pass muster and was put on fatigues, this
      could be anything, cookhouse, toilets, rubbish collecting and this in the
      few hours we had to ourselves, so you soon learnt to smarten up! During
      this period, we had our hair shorn, a big medical where we had to get all
      our shots, T.A.B. TET TOX TYPHUS and Vaccination etc. I can tell you, it
      knocked us for 6 but still had to carry on regardless! Had a circus when
      N.C.Os appeared in our hut to teach us how to fit our webbing equipment
      together and how to clean it! What a lark!  There was a large pack, small
      pack, belt, water bottle holder, bayonet holder, entrenching tool holder,
      Bren Gun pouches etc. all this laced together with various straps! When
      complete, this was known as FULL SERVICE MARCHING ORDER! With this an
      Infantryman would take every thing he possessed with him. Plus of course
      his weapon, this would work out to something in the order of 60-70
      pounds, we were then told that in 2 days time we would be on a route
      march of 15 miles, just a loosener we were told! I had unfortunately got
      on the wrong side of the Sgt. by this time owing to my ability to do all
      the drills etc thanks to my time in the Home guard, so he usually picked
      on me to demonstrate hoping I would fall flat on my face. But the
      feelings were mutual and I managed to stay in front and held my own.  Of
      course during this period, no one was allowed out of Barracks so life was
      really very dreary, just work, work and sleep!<br>
             We were lucky that we were out of the air raids that were still a
      daily part of life in London etc. but we still had the worry for our
      family's back home. For all this treatment we were going through, we were
      paid the princely sum of 10 shillings a week! Me having a dependant
      Mother, had to donate 3 shillings a week to her, so time I bought my
      polishes etc, I was left with very little and used to shine blokes shoes
      for fags etc, real tough times for us. Interesting sideline here. At the
      Buffs depot they have a ceremony that is performed daily to this day!
      Each morning the smartest man on parade is picked out and is trained for
      3 week in cane drill, this implies learning to march, salute and do
      various drills with a cane. Then you are dressed in white gaiters and
      belt with a cross shoulder dispatch belt, white gauntlets and the cane,
      as its is war time and it is obligatory to carry a Gas Mask, another
      squaddie had to follow you carrying your kit.. Then you had to set out to
      march to CANTERBURY CATHEDRAL marching at attention every step of the
      way. Upon reaching the Cathedral at the appointed time 11 A.M., I
      approached the Warriors Chapel. That is just inside, and is separated
      from the main church by an iron form of grill. Inside this Chapel hangs
      all the Battle Honours of the Regiment. Up 3 steps and there facing you
      is a LECTERN, this is holding a large book containing the names of every
      man killed in action of the Buffs. I just cannot remember how long this
      ceremony has been going on but will no doubt find out. On reaching the
      Lectern you stand to attention salute, take off your gauntlets and hat,
      turn the page of the book and it is your duty to report the top left hand
      name to the Guard room on your return. This complete, it is the custom to
      hurry across the street to have your photo taken which someone in the
      family still has, so that was one of the more civilized and pleasant
      memories of my Infantry training at the Buffs Depot in Canterbury! The
      time just sped by here and it was time to move out to more serious work.
      Scattered around the coast of Kent were various units of the Buffs fully
      engaged on defence preparations against the impending invasion. Some were
      guarding the gun emplacements around Dover and the Port etc. Others were
      at Lymn Airdrome and it was my luck to be sent to MANSTON Fighter
      Station. This was situated just behind RAMSGATE and Margate, not a bad
      place to be stationed in normal times but not with German Bombers and
      fighters only 21 miles across the sea! We had to do a month inside the
      actual airdrome where our main duties comprised of anti aircraft using
      quadruple Vickers machine guns and of course general guard duties around
      the airdrome. The sirens were continuously sounding, as there were
      constant air raids from both fighters and bombers. When the sirens
      sounded all R.A.F. personnel not actively involved with actual aircraft
      being used in defence, had to take to the shelters! You can imagine this
      caused some rather sarcastic comments from us poor squaddies regarding
      their manhood, so a certain rivalry was always there when we met any air
      force types in town! After a month of this we went on detachment outside
      the airdrome and our billet was a rather nice Bungalow with extensive
      grounds, this was a paradise and we spent a happy time there but was
      always having to stand to when the invasion looked like happening.<br>
             It was during this period that I managed to make some close
      friends. Most of us were Londoners and one in particular, SYD ANDREWS was
      a very close friend. We were always hard up and as we could get into
      Ramsgate and Margate quite easily on the Passion wagon, the ladies were
      always paramount in our minds. Syd actually was seriously courting the
      Beauty Queen of Ramsgate so he was O.K. He suggested to me one day that I
      wrote to his sister Rosina and be a pen pal and perhaps she would send me
      a parcel which I could share with him! This I eventually did and it
      worked out quite well, as you will find out later. So it wasn't all doom
      and gloom and we had many happy memories of this place. Then one day we
      had orders to move to Folkestone.  Here we were to be stationed in SHORNE
      CLIFFE BARRACKS. Here we were going to train as 3inch Mortar Platoon and
      drivers. Happily I was picked to be a driver though I had to learn all
      aspects of the Mortar as well. I was obviously thrilled to have the
      chance to learn to drive. This course took place with a 30 CWT. GUY truck
      with a CRASH GEAR BOX , No syncro-mesh in those days!<br>
             Before embarking on a long dialogue about the 3inch Mortar and
      driving lessons I must return you to Manston Airdrome as there were so
      many incidents to relate there.  Briefly there was the day the 2 German
      Battleships escaped down the Channel! Everything that could fly was put
      in the air in return Jerry threw everything he had at us to prevent our
      fighters from taking off! This caused one hell of a terrifying day,
      bombed and machined gunned hourly, we had to lay on our backs and fire at
      random at any given target but once you came under fire it was hard to
      get your head off the ground. As you can imagine these were indeed
      exciting times for 18 year olds! We also had a wonderful incident where a
      German Bomber mistaking Manston for a friendly airdrome attempted to
      land, but some keen squaddie put the searchlights on him and he took off.
      A sad sight was to see the Blenheim 2 seater fighter bombers, (Pilot
      &amp; Air Gunner) come back from raids with the air gunner usually shot
      to pieces, a very tough time in the war with casualties daily from the
      bombing and machine gunning.  Shornecliffe, like the Depot was a very old
      Victorian cluster of buildings falling into decay, millions of
      cockroaches and rats, not a very pleasant place! Our training was very
      intense on the Mortar, as a driver I had to learn all aspects of this
      weapon but in action I would be responsible for providing the bombs, and
      if marching, carrying the base plate. As I was issued with a Thompson Sub
      Machine Gun the only feasible way to carry it was round my neck which to
      say the least was very uncomfortable!  Learning to drive on the old 30
      cwt Guy was an education. It had a crash gearbox, which meant really
      waiting for the revs to die down before attempting to change down. It was
      very exciting, and soon we had passed our course and now we were waiting
      the arrival of our Bren Gun Carriers, which would be our means of
      transport. Of course we were the envy of our mates who were now in
      Infantry Platoons and had to march everywhere and were treated as the
      lowest form of life! Magic day came when we got our Carriers! Great
      excitement! Had to learn to drive all over again as being a tracked
      vehicle the technique is completely different. You must have seen
      pictures of the Bren Gun Carrier? All bullet proof steel, V.8 Ford engine
      very low to the ground, what was hard to grasp was, when turning, you
      actually slowed the track on the turning side, the other free track
      driving you round. When proficient this was accomplished by turning the
      steering wheel on and off to get a smooth turn. If over compensated you
      would spin completely round causing havoc, so this took many hours of
      frustrating practice. We also had to learn to negotiate steep hills and
      learn the point of no return where the Carrier would topple over. What
      was the steepest angle you could travel sideways across a slope. It was a
      very intensive and tough course. On top of this of course was the
      maintenance. The tracks causing the most problems. These were joined
      together with a series of rods like a bolt with a hole at the end taking
      a split pin.<br>
             Some transport Officers demanded to be able to see the split pin
      on the outside. Us drivers however preferred them on the inside as
      driving through towns etc you could easily hit the curb and sheer off the
      split pin causing the track to come apart and fly back on top of you, not
      funny! Another feature was the starting handle, this was about 6 ft long!
      It had to be inserted at the front of the carrier, pass through the
      driver's compartment to the engine that was enclosed in the rear. This
      was a very dodgy operation in action, with muck and bullets flying all
      around and you trying to insert this monstrosity through a small hole
      with your crew screaming at you to get going! So now, instead of just
      myself and my weapon to look after, I had a Bren Gun Carrier too! This
      took a lot of my time but I was so pleased to pass out as a driver, and
      life seemed good. We did have one amusing incident though not for the
      Sgt. involved. One day we were learning to ford a river after water
      proofing our vehicle, we entered the water and proceeded slowly to move
      across, hit a hole, carrier submerged partially allowing water to
      overcome the proofing and stop the engine! Sgt was in a bit of a flap
      obviously and said we would go to a nearby transport café and ring for
      help. This we did leaving one guy with the carrier, when we returned with
      the breakdown truck, the carrier had disappeared completely! Poor Sgt
      lost his stripes and we all had a good laugh!. Now we were a fully
      operational unit and felt it wouldn't be long before we would be
      committed to action. All this time we had belonged to the 70th Battalion
      the Buffs, this was because of our age and inexperience and now our
      training was being intensified with many exercises, mock battles with
      sheep's blood smeared on us for effect, assault courses etc.<br>
             Such is the mysterious way of the Army, for no apparent reason we
      had to move to OLD PARK BARRACKS DOVER! While we thought we were on the
      move for overseas. Here we were stationed in Barracks again with all the
      old B/S of the Depot. Drill parades, P.T. Route Marches, church parades
      etc. what a carry on. It was here that I had my Tattoo done in SNARGATE
      ST. Dover during a shelling raid, which was quite common and very scary!
      Incidentally I had my girl friends' name tattooed on my right arm and did
      I have a bad arm! It festered and caused me a lot of grief so no more for
      me I thought! All this time I had been writing to my mate Syd Andrew's
      sister Rosina. She did actually write to me and send the odd parcel, it
      was a long time before she sent me a photo but when she did I was
      overcome, she was so beautiful, just like YVONNE DE CARLO honest!<br>
             Soon we were on the move again! This time to the last place God
      made we thought! It was near a small village named HEDON on the Yorkshire
      Moors! Never did get to the village. It was a God forsaken place! Wet,
      Cold, miserable, we thought no where could be as bad as this place!
      Unfortunately we were soon to find out differently! It was certainly the
      most depressing time we had spent so far in the Army but soon we were
      told we were off overseas.<br>
      We all had to take embarkation leave which was a relief to get away from
      Yorkshire! It was on this leave that I eventually met Rosina (your
      mum).</font>
