These are my early recollections of life for a baby in the thirties.
 I was born at an early age, as we mostly are, at 58, Rowden Road,
 Beckenham, Kent. 5.30 am. on September 11th, 1934, to be precise.
 That is just between Cater Park and Clock House Station.<BR><BR>
 Amongst the most vivid of my memories might be the enamel "po" my
 Mum used to warm by the fire to get me to sit on. She once warmed it
 so well it burned my butt!<BR><BR>
