       <h3>1942 Start of the GREAT UNKNOWN!</h3>
    </div>
    <p align="left">

      A very grey overcast day as we started to embark on the ship taking us on
      a voyage we know not where. We looked in dismay at the scruffy appearance
      of this ship! Everything about it looked in need of repair and a good
      clean up, we were put down somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the smell
      was like nothing we had ever experienced. We were told in no uncertain
      manner, "HERE YOU ARE AND HERE YOU STAY UNTIL YOU ARE TOLD TO MOVE! NO
      ONE IS ALLOWED UP ON DECK UNLESS TOLD SO!" We looked around to find that
      we were so closely bunched it would be impossible for all of us to lay
      down! We were then told to use the mess table to sleep on if there isn't
      enough room in the hammocks and floor! What a start to our adventure I
      ask you? We were nearly all youngsters, mainly 18 &amp; 19 year olds.
      Mostly from LONDON and all mixed up from different Regiments going out as
      reinforcements. A few dozen of us BUFFS were going to join the BUFFS 5th
      Battalion who had just landed in BONE in NORTH  AFRICA which obviously we
      did not know at the time. We had no idea where we were going until the
      4th. day at sea!<br>
            Eventually we sorted out our sleeping positions, many laughs with
      squaddies hitting the floor with a thud as they fell out their hammocks,
      others during that first night who were sleeping on the tables fell onto
      floor with language you wouldn't believe! Remember we had all our kit,
      equipment weapons etc with us so it was a real job to keep an eye on it
      at times. At last an officer came to give us a talk. He said there is
      nothing that can be done to improve the conditions, there is a war on,
      (as if we didn't know!) because of the condition of the ship, the number
      of men on board etc etc, we could only be fed one meal a day! Good news
      was however, there was a N.A.A.F.I. shop on board where we could buy
      things to help us from being hungry! Can you believe that!  This did not
      go down well at all and we all kicked up a stink about buying our own
      grub! What about the blokes who have no money?  etc. etc. After much talk
      and argy bargy the powers that be relented and said whatever food we got
      would be free but would be strictly rationed! After talking to some of
      the crew we were told that we were the only nationality who hadn't
      rebelled on the voyage!<br>
            Eventually we heard and felt the engines start up and we were on
      our way, we knew it was nighttime but of course were not allowed on deck.
      We were a very miserable and crest fallen crowd I can tell you. If we
      could have got off that ship we would have all done a bunk!! We tried, oh
      how we tried to get some sleep but movement of the ship and being so near
      the engines it was impossible, blokes were being sick, others were
      fighting it was mayhem, nothing can be as bad as this we thought! Little
      did we know what was in store for us! The lights all came on! REGIMENTAL
      SERGEANT MAJOR with some officers came in with 2 N.C.Os. They came to do
      a roll call! Someone had got on deck and gone over the side! Because of
      U-BOATS the ship could not stop! Poor guy! Eventually we were told it was
      a GRENADIER GUARDSMAN who had gone over board! Later on his kit was
      sorted out and they had a collection for his family, I can't remember how
      much we got now but it made us realise that were now on active service
      even on this floating disaster! Certain times of the day were allowed on
      deck to do exercises and weapon training and of course the ever present
      inspections. We were in threat of severe punishment if caught throwing
      ANYTHING and I mean ANYTHING over the side, this was in case a U-BOAT
      could find it and know there was an enemy boat nearby.<br>
            Some guys can easily adapt themselves to any conditions they find
      themselves in. This was the case here, all of a sudden the place became
      like a casino in Las Vegas! HOUSEY HOUSEY, CROWN &amp; ANCHOR and many
      varied card games sprang up all over the place! HOUSEY HOUSEY was my pet
      hate! It went on and on for hours and hours, I have never willingly or
      knowingly ever been to BINGO as it's now called,  in my life since then!
      Cannot honestly remember how long we took on this voyage but at last land
      was in sight, we were allowed up on deck and were like a crowd of young
      kids seeing the sea for the first time! Whoops of joy and cheering could
      have been heard back in the U.K. the noise we made. The sun was burning
      us, I often have a laugh when I have to listen to my golfing partners
      here in COMOX tell me stories of the heat in MANITOBA etc. Man this was
      scorching us! As we neared the land we could pick out white buildings
      just like you see on the films. One of the crew told us we were pulling
      into ALGIERS! What we all knew about ALGIERS would have gone on a postage
      stamp! Most of the blokes didn't even know what continent it was on! So
      at last we disembarked from this bloody HELL SHIP and were dispatched in
      troop carriers to a holding camp somewhere on the outskirts of the city.
      We were billeted in tents that we had to put up ourselves, of course
      coming from LONDON we were all expert at this and eventually managed to
      get a beautiful hot meal! GOOD OLD BULLY BEEF STEW AND RICE PUDDING! Went
      down a real treat I can tell you! Next morning back to reality! Parades,
      inspections and drill etc etc. Sorted out into our different units, told
      we were being allowed into town. Never go about in less than threes.
      Always carry your sidearms (BAYONETS) keep out of the KASBAR, keep away
      from the women, watch what you eat and where you ate. Assembly point for
      return to camp at a certain time or else! So off we jolly well go!
      ALGIERS EH? First thing  we want a good nosh up! This being a FRENCH
      COLONY the food would be French obviously, there were no MACDONALDS or
      BURGERS in those days! We managed to get something that looked like beef,
      probably horse and taters etc and then some fruit and lots of wine!
      Everything in the garden was rosy! We saw some dates for sale in the
      KASBAR (our first big mistake)!  Upon our return to camp much the worse
      for wear owing to the plonk we drank, we all had the runs in a very big
      way! We were all very ill and found we had dysentery! There were about 7
      of us who had ate these dates. We were taken to a field and put in big
      tent on our own, we felt like dying, it was as if we were dying, they
      pumped us up with so many drugs and of course with the heat and the smell
      we almost wished we were back on ship again! This of course passed and we
      were back on track again only to find ourselves in front of an officer on
      a charge!  SELF INFLICTED WOUND, EATING FORBIDDEN FRUIT! I had heard of
      course about FORBIDDEN FRUIT but I thought it should have been a lot
      nicer than getting dysentery! Our punishment was 7days LATRINE DUTY! Can
      you imagine that? We did have a laugh about it though! Even though our
      mates never came near us etc etc. Soon it was time to leave to join our
      BATTALION, who were further up the coast. Off we went to the Railway
      station, where we were herded into cattle trucks that said 40 men or 8
      horses!<br>
            By now all we had was our F.S.M.O FIELD SERVICE MARCHING ORDER, Kit
      bag left in ALGIERS and we never ever saw them again! I should mention
      here for the uninitiated that FSMO consisted of a big back pack with
      change of clothes etc, Underneath, and attached was our small pack that
      carried our eating irons, mess tins washing gear etc. Then you had your
      respirator on your chest between two pouches that carried spare magazines
      for the Bren gun. In your front trouser pocket was a field dressing,
      hanging from your belt at the back was your water bottle, entrenching
      tool (a small shovel for digging in) and of course your bayonet and the
      rifle or weapon you carried plus your steel helmet. Reason for telling
      you all this will make sense later on. Once again my memory fails me as
      to the time we spent on the train. We had no blankets and only BULLY BEEF
      sandwiches and when the train stopped, they gave us tea again. In AFRICA,
      after the boiling sun of the day, the nights were perishing cold! So once
      again we were in the depths of despair and not a happy crew! After a
      terrible night we woke to the sun and another sandwich and a cup of tea,
      out into the sand dunes to do what soldiers do in the sand dunes when
      they have been well fed! Then we were told we would be stopping for 2
      hours to take on water and or the train! <br>
            This is where it gets interesting! Someone espied what looked like
      an Arab village in the far distance across the desert! Off we jolly well
      went with just the clothes we stood up in! Reached the village, we were
      starving! Had money to burn! Managed to conjure us up some fried eggs and
      bread and a terrible kind of jollop, foul tasting really but had a kick
      to it! Soon we were oblivious to anything except eating and drinking...
      then one of the lads said.... "LISTEN! ISN'T THAT THE TRAIN?" "NO!"
      everyone replied and on we carried with the GOODIES? Eventually one the
      party least affected by our feast of goodies said with exclamation
      "CHRIST ALMIGHTY! IT IS THE F........G TRAIN! LOOK! IT'S F.......MILES
      AWAY!" WELL , everyone went silent and in a mad rush we were out of there
      running like mad men towards the train without a hope in hell of ever
      catching it!  What a calamity! Here we were 7 or 8 of us, can't recall
      exactly and as I am the sole survivor of this caper you will just have to
      believe me! Suddenly it hit us! We are in hostile land with no weapons or
      any means to support ourselves, miles from anywhere, possibly posted as
      deserters, easy prey for any marauding Arab bands who hated us as much as
      the Germans! What a caper! We soon jointly realised the only course open
      to us was to follow the railway track hoping to find any sort of
      civilization along the way!<br>
           By this time we had tried to work out why no one had missed us and
      sent out a search party. Afterwards we found out the OFFICERS were having
      a party in their CARRIAGE with lots of grub and booze and as we were all
      different groups from various regiments, no one seemed to miss us or care
      for that matter. So we start off on this journey, by now the sun was at
      its highest, I have to bite my tongue here when I have to listen to
      CANADIANS trying to impress me with the heat on the prairies! This was
      blinding heat that was only just possible to breath in, no shade except
      for the odd CACTUS BUSH, our khaki was soaking wet and stuck to us, every
      step was agony through the sand, we had been taught that cactus pears
      held water so we tried! These are really  extremely prickly with needle
      like spikes, any sort of wound in this heat soon goes septic so we were
      very careful, one of us had a knife and by holding the pear with a stick
      off the bush we eventually managed to learn how to get some liquid. We
      came across a little oasis and found a date tree which was very welcome,
      We soon realised that if we were caught out in the desert at night, we
      could die of hypothermia so we pressed on as fast as humanly possible,
      swearing and moaning at our luck.<br>
      Then we came across an old abandoned railway shed, much the worse for
      wear, decided to spend the night there as we were exhausted and the sun
      was going down making it much cooler. We ate some dates and some prickly
      pears juice that was nearby and tried to settle down for the night
      sleeping as close to one another for warmth. Well, we survived the night
      and woke to the blazing sun again. Soon we were off again along the
      track, keeping off the sand as much as possible, as it soon drifted onto
      the track. Amazingly we never saw another train as we expected, but we
      trudged on relentlessly getting very weary and weak from lack of food. We
      must have looked a frightful mess, no wash or shave, uniforms ragged and
      soaked with sweat. Worst of all was our feet! Combination of the sweat
      mixed with sand had caused us so many blisters is was hard to put one
      foot in front of another! Then UTOPIA! We could see in the far distance
      signs of some form of civilization! With great shouts of jubilation our
      spirits lifted We marched on with renewed vigor.  What we found on
      arriving was a small Arab village and a stop for the train, where they
      took on traders and their goods etc. They were very suspicious of us, and
      we were very wary of them. We kept our distance looking for some one in
      authority, Police or anyone able to talk to and help us. Just then an
      Army lorry pulled in! WOW! What a relief! We fell on him as if he was the
      MESSIAH returning to earth, I can tell you.<br>
      Soon we arrived at a large HOLDING CAMP.  This is where all the odds and
      sods of different units, reinforcements for units up the front, units
      being transferred etc etc. are held awaiting movement orders. These
      places are unbelievably chaotic! No one actually belongs to anyone and
      people are completely disorganised, Most people working as staff in these
      places are usually misfits, people found wanting and totally useless in a
      combat unit, so in reality they are surplus to requirements as the Army
      say. Into this cauldron of organised chaos we are thrown! First up in
      front of the COMMANDING OFFICER! What a sorry sight we must have looked! 
      Disheveled filthy dirty, unshaven etc.  A COMPANY SERGEANT MAJOR of the
      WELSH GUARDS, who was most unpleasant, marched us in!  The C.O. a
      peacetime soldier and a heavy drinker by his bulbous nose and scarlet
      complexion. He looked at us in disdain and it was moments before he
      spoke. He was looking us over as though pricing cattle at a market!
      "Right, you men, I wont be punishing you here, I will have to leave that
      to your unit where I'm sure you will be COURT MARTIALLED and end up in
      the GLASSHOUSE!" (MILITARY PRISON!) In the meantime you will have a full
      medical to see what diseases you have brought with you, you will then be
      issued for new equipment which you will pay for every item. You will
      receive some pay once we have confirmed who you are. You will receive
      your free issue of cigarettes but you will not frequent the N.A.F.F.I. or
      at any time, participate in any sport or recreation!<br>
            You will also be under close arrest and any further mutinous
      conduct will be dealt with very severely here, so keep your noses clean!
      During your short, I hope, stay here, you will be attached to a unit of
      WELSH GUARDS who are here. You will come under them for all duties.
      PARADES, inspections etc, when not required by them you will be on
      constant fatigues, in the cookhouse or wherever detailed by the C.S.M.
      You are all a disgrace to your unit and I hope they can knock some sense
      into you before you go into action! DISMISS! Off we were marched to the
      ablutions (showers) and then issued with new kit, everything except
      weapons! They sure didn't trust us did they? So began some of the most
      miserable days of our Army service, little did we know what was in store
      for us up the road! This sergeant major set out to make our lives
      miserable, but we had a unique way of getting back at him! As I told you,
      we were all LONDONERS so we talked to each other in COCKNEY RHYMING
      SLANG! So anytime he was in earshot we would talk to one another
      insulting him and what ever task he gave us, we would laugh and drive him
      mad. One punishment he loved to give us was double march, sort of
      trotting with full pack and as we were not allowed rifles we had to run
      holding poles above our heads. This was normally very weakening but such
      was our determination to upset him that we used to sing Cockney songs
      that really got to him. Then he would give us drill, it is not generally
      known but the GUARDS drill is quite different from INFANTRY drill so we
      used to deliberately muck his commands up! I'm sure if we had been there
      about a month we would have sent him mental.<br>
    </p>
    <p align="center">

      ACTION!<br>
    </center>
    <p align="left">
      Soon we were gathered together fully kitted out including rifles but no
      ammunition! 2 RED CAPS (military Police) were put in charge of us, loaded
      onto a lorry and off we went to join our future unit. Now we are all
      silent fearing and wondering what was in store for us. How would we react
      in our first action? Would we hold up? Would be so scared as to scarper?
      All these doubts and fears were uppermost in our minds as we moved toward
      the front. Soon the noise of battle became audible! In the distance,
      shellfire could be heard, this was daytime in the early afternoon, now
      the noise of guns became much nearer as we approached our own artillery
      that was in action. Here we passed the many units that form B-ECHELON as
      the units that support the Infantry are named. It is a little known fact,
      but there are around 7 men supporting the infantry for every one front
      line combat soldier. We were to pass these same people many times during
      the years that followed, and it really irks when you realise they got
      exactly the same medals as us with out ever seeing a live German! Plus
      they had all the comforts of living very safely in lorries and what ever
      cover was available. Always had a bed and blankets, hot food and water
      etc. In fact, by comparison, my poor old Mother who was bombed out of our
      house and lived most nights out in the garden in an air raid shelter, and
      thousands like her, should have more medals than these guys! So now you
      will begin to understand what life is like as a front line INFANTRY MAN
      and why I listen to so many stories from blokes who had a good time
      compared to us and why my medals mean very little to me!<br>
      We eventually pull up in a sort of olive grove. Here the Battalion was
      dispersed as well as could be managed, and not too much air activity from
      JERRY as it was just the beginning of the war here. First we were taken
      to an officer who more or less told us there was a war on, we would be
      assigned to companies who would determine what job we would be doing. He
      then told us that when it got dark, we would be moving into the line on
      foot to take over from the HAMPSHIRES. These poor guys had taken a
      beating driving off a big German attack and had suffered terrible
      casualties. They made sure they split us up, informing us that our past
      actions would be dealt with at a later date and that a good show here
      would help us to wipe out what had happened. I was assigned to "A"
      COMPANY and told I was to be BREN GUNNER and who was to be my no2. This,
      despite having been trained as MORTAR PLATOON CARRIER DRIVER! Of course I
      had also been trained as a BRENGUNNER as all Infantrymen have. Now the
      "MOMENT OF TRUTH!" was nigh! We were moving up to the front! Oh how I
      wished I could have been that lorry driver who had brought us here and
      then turned round and gone back to his safe billet and a good nights kip
      after a nice hot meal! We were now marching into the dark night, having
      been warned about being quiet, no smoking etc. Off we trudged, each with
      their thoughts and fears of what lay ahead. After what seemed an eternity
      we came across some wounded "HAMPSHIRE LADS being evacuated, those that
      could speak were shouting out"GOOD LUCK!" or other words. Then we came up
      with the main body who seemed in a real mess, wounded laying around in
      complete disorder it appeared.<br>
      It was only after the action that we found out what had happened! The
      Germans had attacked with tanks and infantry, it is worth noting here
      that the GERMANS were hardy battle trained veterans of previous victories
      in the Desert, and Europe against our poorly trained and virgin troops
      with no previous experience, so there was no contest really. Well, it
      appears some brain dead strategist in LONDON had decided in his wisdom,
      that it would be a smart thing to let the attacking tanks drive over the
      trenches with the HAMPSHIRE lads in them. Then they could just pop up and
      knock the jolly old tanks out don't you know! Must have sounded
      absolutely wizard in dear old London. Unfortunately the Germans had other
      ideas and instead of driving over the trenches, they spun round on them
      and caused unbelievable carnage to the guys in the trenches leaving many
      dead and terribly maimed! So this is what we had to avenge! No such
      heroic thoughts entered our minds contrary to the American film versions
      of their Army! So now we were being put in our positions gradually taking
      over from the other lads. All the time there is constant shelling from
      both our artillery and the Germans. It is interesting to note here that
      hearing and recognising sounds is one of the first requisites of a good
      infantryman! What's that? Is it one of our shells going over there? Is
      that a German Spandau machine gun or a Bren or Vickers etc. etc. One of
      the worse weapons we feared was the "MOANING MINNIE!" this was a multi
      barreled MORTAR with special pieces in the fins that made a horrible
      screaming noise in its descent! This was really a corker and truly
      unnerving to the uninitiated to say the least! The really horrifying
      aspect of all kinds of MORTAR is that they explode on impact and all the
      blast carrying the shrapnel is ground level causing many terrible wounds.
      Shells, specially the big ones, you only hear the final swish as it nears
      you and it usually makes a big hole and destroys anything within a fair
      area depending on what size shell. All you can do is dig a hole and get
      in it, keep your head down and pray! Problem with that is, whilst they
      are shelling you, their Infantry will be attacking you behind the
      barrage, so you still have to be alert! That's when you keep saying to
      yourself "WHAT THE F... AM I DOING HERE? WHY DIDN'T I JOIN THE AIR
      FORCE?"<br>
            So now we have taken over from the "HAMPSHIRES" everyone is in
      position with their own jobs to do. "A" COMPANY (mine!) is to lead the
      attack "B" &amp; "C" companies on our flanks and "D" company in reserve.
      This action was named "HILL 303. Not one of the great battles that make
      the history books, just one action that was to take place many times over
      the next few months so I will take a little time in trying to put into
      words my personal feelings and actions in this attack on "HILL 303". Yes
      it was a hill we had to take, I had been ordered to put 1 in 7 tracer
      bullets in my magazines this was to see where my shots were going. Later
      on when experienced we tended to ignore this order and put 1 in 12 as 1in
      7 gave the opposition a good idea where you were firing from and drew
      their fire. The next problem as if there wasn't enough to think about was
      MINES! When you are moving up into an attack, the "ROYAL ENGINEERS" sweep
      the ground for mines up to a point, then they lay a white ribbon across,
      from then on, you are on your own. Now there is so much going on around
      you, Mortars exploding, shells exploding machine gun fire sweeping past
      and overhead, your mind is in a panic situation! Every fibre of your body
      is screaming out to you to get out of there! Where can you go? The whole
      world has gone mad! Mates are dropping all around you and yet you are
      still going up the hill? YOU'RE F...... MAD! A voice keeps saying quietly
      and calmly, "KEEP GOING LADS" "DON"T LIE DOWN! KEEP GOING ON FIRING AT
      TARGETS AS THEY APPEAR!' This was one of our young officers who were
      killed in this action! I am firing my Bren Gun in the general direction
      of the fire coming towards us. The barrel of my Bren gets hot, I shout at
      my no. 2 for a spare barrel, I change it and carry on firing, suddenly we
      have gained the top, a few stragglers, some wounded, we finish them all
      off, now it is getting much quieter! An eerie silence spreads over the
      area like a blanket, just the odd shells from the GERMANS but multitudes
      from our guns bearing on the Germans retreating!<br>
      Now we are in possession of the hilltop and have to prepare for a counter
      attack that will surely come! Hurriedly we start to dig in, don't need
      any order to do this! Entrenching tool getting red hot , digging into the
      rocky ground working like Irish labourers on pay day! Having done that we
      have to dispose of the many German dead that are laying around. This we
      do hurriedly with no fuss, making sure we relieved them of any LUGER
      PISTOLS etc. Then we were treated to a fantastic sound! "GRUB UP!" It
      must be mentioned here that our QUARTERMASTER whose name I'm ashamed to
      say I have forgotten! When ever humanly possible, would somehow manage to
      get some form of hot food and tea to us. Sometimes by JEEP, CARRIER, MULE
      or even, by hand! In fact he was decorated for his work and one of the
      true heroes of our mob. It was such a treat even though it was only
      "BULLY BEEF" STALE BREAD and HOT TEA" it was better than the RITZ! Soon
      we were called to "STAND TO!" in preparation of the expected counter
      attack, it was just about dawn with the sun below the hills, the area we
      were in was really the coastal strip, scrub land, mostly small hills and
      valleys with the desert stretching out beyond the hills. It was that
      horrible half light! Hold up! Here it comes!  Jerry artillery was
      beginning to get our range! Shells dropping all round us, noise like you
      cannot believe, keep your head down with the odd look over the top to see
      if they are coming! Cries of "STRETCHER BEARER!" mixed with the moaning
      of the wounded. Your mouth goes dry, smoke fag after fag! Check your
      equipment etc, check the no.2 seeing if he has the spare barrel and
      magazines ready. Mind playing tricks, that one was near! How lucky can
      you get, hope I get out of this OK. A thousand confused thoughts, mostly
      fearful are spinning through your head! No time to dwell now! Here they
      come!  Grey horde could be dimly seen approaching in large numbers at the
      foot of the hill, the barrage had moved off of our area now and was
      searching for guns behind. Now their Mortars are starting to arrive in a
      most unwelcome manner!<br>
      God! What a bloody mess to be in! "OPEN UP! RAPID FIRE!" Start firing
      into the mass below. Heavier machine guns. VICKERS HEAVY MACHINE GUNS and
      4.2 MORTARS opened up behind us pouring heavy fire into the approaching
      JERRIES below, Their casualties were very heavy. Suddenly their attack
      lost its momentum and as they tried to withdraw in some sort of
      formation, they moved into a barrage laid down by our 25 pounders behind
      us, who were in close support. So briefly the counter attack had failed
      and we were still there, but had paid a very heavy price with numerous
      casualties. Our dead and wounded were over 250. Many good mates had bit
      the dust, and it is very hard to take. These guys you had lived with, 24
      hours a day, and we were just like a family, We knew each other's habits
      and shared everything. Good times and bad and you couldn't avoid getting
      close because we all had to rely on one another and this is how you got
      the comradeship that is really unique among Infantrymen. Of course, like
      any walk in life, you get your bad eggs, but they are soon shown up for
      what they are, because there is no hiding place in these situations.
      Everyone has a job and if you are found wanting you pay for it in many
      ways, both by your mates and the powers that be!<br>
            I have tried here to give my impression of my reactions and
      thoughts of my first action. Every single soldier unless brain dead has
      more or less the same story of their thoughts, fears and hopes when being
      thrown into the unknown like this! Will I be scared? You sure will! Will
      I be too scared and run? You can never be sure! How much more can you
      take? Only time will tell! When will my turn come? How will I be hit? A
      terrible wound? Lose a limb? Lose my sight? Taken prisoner? Then of
      course there is always the fear of showing that fear that can cause you
      not to do your job, and so make others in danger! All these thoughts go
      racing through your mind. Then it is over!  Heavy sighs of relief. Having
      done a good job, now its time to regroup, get fresh supplies of ammo and
      try and find out how your close mates have fared. Very sad when someone
      very close to you has bought it. Now you are kept so busy burying dead
      and clearing up the mess etc. Now we have to regroup, filling up empty
      places in the Platoons and sections with guys from the Reserve Company.
      This is quite hard as now they have lost their intimate and close friends
      and have to get to know us, this is always happening in the Army, making
      friends and losing them, very sad. So I was so glad that I had come
      through all this without a scratch only dents in my mind of mans
      inhumanity to man!<br>
      Now we are re-grouping before moving off again. This is a very tiresome
      procedure with endless inspections of equipment etc, plus inspections of
      us, i.e. washed and shaved, uniforms clean etc.etc, specially feet as we
      need them to walk on! Soon we are off again, another unit has leap
      frogged us and made contact again with the retreating Germans and now it
      is our turn again! We soon hear the sound of the battle ahead, and now
      hear the shells from our guns going over (we hope!) our heads, searching
      for their target on enemy positions.  Eventually we arrive and take over
      from the WEST KENTS, they are another battalion of our 3 battalion
      Brigade, the other battalion being the ARGYLE &amp; SUTHERLAND
      HIGHLANDERS.<br>
      The usual total confusion in taking over. Eventually we take up their
      positions on a small hill top overlooking a valley with more hills
      occupied by Jerry in the distance. Here we were to stay static for a
      while, not good as Jerry having been there himself, knew exactly our
      range and was pasting us pretty good with mortars etc. These are truly
      awesome weapons as they explode on contact and all the blast and shrapnel
      is scattered primarily ground high causing unbelievable casualties! All
      you can do is DIG DEEP and stay there as much as you can! Unfortunately
      this is a time when the powers that be, stuck some miles back think we
      had better have something to do! So they organise patrols! Some are just
      listening and probing patrols to find out exactly where Jerry is and if
      possible in what strength. Then there are the FIGHTING PATROLS where you
      are supposed to catch prisoners so that our INTELLIGENCE Officers in the
      safe Billet miles back, can try and determine what unit the prisoners are
      from, and out of that information, if given, they can get an idea who is
      leading them. From that get an idea what plan he might be making.<br>
      These can be quite terrifying ordeals because now you are moving into
      unknown ground, known only to the enemy and you have no idea where, or if
      he has laid mines!  As most patrols are done at night, the procedure is
      to old the man's bayonet in front, try  to step in his footsteps hereby 
      lessening the risk of stepping on a mine, the mines that would be laid in
      this situations would be "S" mines, these are really nasty babies! Once
      trod on, they jump 6 feet in the air and blow your head off! There were
      other mines but you can judge for yourself that it is not a pleasant walk
      in the park. Another frightening aspect of this is, Jerry would
      deliberately leave dead bodies around complete with a LUGER or MAUSER
      REVOLVER on the body. These would be BOOBY TRAPPED for anyone curious or
      after souveniers, so this was strictly a No NO!  On these patrols which
      occur quite often, the Army never like to leave you alone  for long, they
      are afraid you will think" WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE!" and bugger off
      to better climes! As I was saying, on these occasions is when you learn
      to act &amp; behave as an animal does all its life! Listening for any
      unusual sound or smell, instinctively sensing danger, looking for and
      taking advantage of every bit of cover available! A tree here, a bush
      there, a ditch over there! Always looking for somewhere to duck into if
      needs be.<br>
            That is one good reason I have never wanted to hunt a poor animal
      unless I needed it for food, and even then I would need to be very
      hungry! As I have told my Canadian friends who think hunting is exciting!
      It would be a  more exciting if the animals shot back at you! <br>
            During this period, the newspapers back home would be reporting "A
      LULL lN THE WAR!" believe me, there were very few lulls for us. All this
      time is well to remember that all we have with us, is what we stand up
      in. Our weapons, &amp; small pack containing our toilet gear and mess
      tins to eat and drink out of. No luxuries like blankets etc. Just a GAS
      CAPE to protect us from the cold night air. Another point I would like to
      make here is, if you looked around at us gathered together, it would not
      look any different than a picture of the young lads at uour local High
      School!! Such was our age! Young boys thrown into this madness and making
      men of them very quickly! Soon we were on the move again, more skirmishes
      and attacks which I will gloss over as there were too many to report
      until we reached our final battle in North Africa!<br>
            This became known as the BATTLE OF LONG STOPHILL! This was to be a
      daytime attack on the hill, we assembled at our starting point, we had
      strict orders that we were not  to lay down but to keep on going! We were
      dished out with a large RUM ration which really burned our mouth and then
      we were  off  through the poppy fields. Supporting us were TANKS of the
      "NORTH IRISH HORSE" Section leaders were given VERY LIGHT PISTOLS and
      upon seeing a target, jump on the tank, press a button and then fire the
      pistol to the direction of the target. The tank would then fire off a few
      rounds in that area, in the meantime, we were walking forward firing at
      everything we could at any and every movement on the hill. Only problem
      with this is, you very quickly run out of ammunition and have to get
      replacements, remember this the next time you see all those heroes on
      t.v. firing away like crazy! Where do they keep all that ammo, it weighs
      quite heavy and you would need a lorry behind you to fire like they
      do!<br>
            Eventually we drove Jerry off of there and took up his positions
      and prepared to consolidate. Our casualties were unbelievable! How on
      earth did we manage to survive? Look around and see who is missing, too
      many friends have gone OH! GOD! what a mess! When is it all going to end?
      How much more of this can I stand! All these and many more thoughts came
      racing through my mind until the order came to start burying the German
      dead! This was not to be one our better days! First, the bodies were in
      an awful state! Covered in fleas and maggots, grossly swollen due to body
      gasses, most completely rigid due to RIGOR MORTIS setting in! This meant
      breaking arms and legs, or dig a bigger hole! This onerous task
      completed, we found ourselves cooty as hell, scratching and burning the
      lice off our clothes and bodies etc.<br>
            This was soon to end when a MOBILE BATH UNIT appeared on the scene!
      Never had any idea the Army had such a unit!  We were washed and treated,
      dished out all new clothes and what a fantastic feeling to be clean and
      free of lice! We were dancing about in joy like babes in the woods. We
      were told we could stand down and move out. The war in AFRICA was over!
      WOW ! what joy! We all had thoughts of going home, and started writing
      home to that effect, little did we know they were all censored and our
      folk back home never got them! Soon after, we were taken to a lovely spot
      on the coast near to TUNIS the capital city of TUNISIA, this was a lovely
      spot with a glorious beach  named HAMMERMET which is now a very popular
      holiday resort.<br>

    <p align="left">
      <br>
      Here we spent a fantastic few days rollicking in the sea and sand, had
      good food, letters from home etc. Soon were ordered on   parade and fully
      expected to hear we were going home! All these beautiful thoughts were
      soon dispelled however when told there is still a war on and we were an
      important part of it! So forget any thoughts of going home! Then to
      really rub it in, we were told there would be  alot of hard work coming
      as we had to prepare to smarten up in preparation for the big VICTORY
      MARCH through TUNIS in a few days time! This became a real pain in the
      butt! It was just like when we joined up! Completely back to basics,
      endless drill and inspections, never a moment without someone breathing
      down your neck checking you were cleaning your equipment etc. At last the
      day came for the parade. We were taken by troop carrier to the outskirts
      of the town and camped out on some wasteland in tents. They got us up at
      the crack of dawn for breakfast,  more drill and inspections hours before
      the parade was due to start.<br>
      By now we were not happy campers as you can imagine, the sun was really
      blazing down in the 90s and becoming unbearable. Then at last we were
      marching. It was quite a parade as there were so many contingents from
      numerous countries. All the commonwealth counries with their small
      contingents and of course the YANKS who were really all playing it like
      film stars as usual! Soon it was over, quite a spectacle really but we
      could happilly have stayed out of it on the beach! That is where we
      returned to, only to be gliby informed that our "HOLIDAY" was now
      officially over! To our horror we were told that now we would have to get
      down to some serious training as we were on the team to invade SICILY!!
      This came as a terrible blow as we really thought we had seen and done
      all the combat and that we would be going home or at least stay here and
      enjoy ourselves for a long time! OH! NO! Now it was tough training hour
      after hour in the blazing sun and baking sand. I should mention here that
      the sand and heat combined, affected our skin in a very unpleasant
      fashion, it caused sores on any sort of scratch or sore, quite often
      causing it to turn septic. The only treatment for this, was a  cream
      named "JENSEN VIOLET!" this was in a violent colour, hence the name. As
      we were always knocking ourselves and cutting whilst shaving erc, we were
      constantly walking about covered in violet patches! No wonder Jerry named
      us "CHURCHILLS BUTCHERS!" On that note, I will leave you in TUNISIA!
      GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDENCE TO AFRICA, What we wonder will be in store for
      us in SICILY? We were soon to find Out!<br>
      Before leaving Africa, I have omitted a vary important part of this
      story! After the Victory March through TUNIS, we were gathered on parade
      to meet the new intake of Officers straight from Officer School. We were 
      numbered off and marched off with an officer and I found out I had been
      selected as a STRETCHER BEARER! No use arguing and complaining, the deed
      is done we are told! This meant having an extensive and hurried course on
      first aid etc. There were 4 of us chosen, all LONDONERS and we sure did
      have a moan. So with heavy hearts and a bloody stretcher to carry, we
      were off on our way to SICILY and what awaited us there!<br>
      So here we are landing in EUROPE! We were not the original assault group
      so our landing was without incident. We moved inland and spread ourselves
      out in an olive grove, the heat was nearly as bad as Africa! Big
      difference here though, in AFRICA the water was obviously strictly
      rationed!, we now had plenty.  Now we get the bad news! Our supplies have
      landed somewhere else and would take some time to get here!  In the
      meantime eat some olives and almond nuts of which there plenty! No one is
      to even think about eating their emergency rations which is a very
      concentrated slab of special chocolate in a tin which most men kept in
      their field dressing pocket on their thigh. The field dressing was a
      large medicated pad complete with long bandage that could be applied to
      large open wounds. Soon we were indulging ourselves on a feast of olives,
      almond nuts, and for dessert, some grapes and a lemon! This was soon
      followed by sounds of entrenching tools going to work as everyone was
      enriching the already fertile Sicilian soil! Now we were really hungry,
      so now some of us more adventurous souls went in search of something to
      eat, it was here that we found the real state of the country that the
      Germans had stripped clean! The people were in the worst condition
      physically and mentally we were ever likely to see. Their only source of
      food we found was some MAISE spread out on the ground and then mashed
      with water or a drop of goats milk if there was a goat left after the
      Germans had passed by! As for medicine etc, absolutely non existed, we
      could have used up our entire supply in dressing the few local peasants
      in this small area and when we got to a town, the problem was
      heartbreaking!<br>
      We were soon on our way and into action, the terrain was pretty tough as
      we were in the foothills of the mountains and here we were soon to learn
      that the Germans always had control of us because be always fell back
      into prepared positions. This meant they  had us in their sights with the
      exact range for their guns. .Here we had some really frightening
      experiences with the infamous STUKA dive bomber that came down vertically
      with an ear shattering scream! Hug the ground and hope for the best, this
      caused absolute sheer terror in us, no where to hide, just stay there and
      take it. Apart from the bombs they dropped they were raking the ground
      with heavy machine gun fire, this is where our animal instincts of
      survival came into being. Every second you are above ground, your eyes
      are searching for the nearest cover, your ears have learned to
      differentiate the different noises, our  guns,  their guns, heavy guns
      light guns, machine guns etc. The German weapons were superior to ours in
      ever way, specially the NEBEL WURFER! This was a really horrific weapon.
      It was a multi barreled kind of large Mortar, it made the most
      unbelievable screaming noise on its descent and of course, being multi
      barreled, when landing, the impact was truly horrific! No place to be
      above ground. Then there was the FLAME THROWER which speaks for itself,
      having had to attend to so many who   got in the way of these inhuman
      weapons I can assure you that first degree  burns are not a pretty sight
      and the smell of burning flesh stays with you for ever!<br>
      Before continuing with our actions, I thought I would Just take a few
      moments explaining our eating arrangements, each man is issued with 2
      mess tins that fit inside each other, both with longish handles. they are
      kept in your small packet with your eating irons, these you have with you
      always, plus the inevitable enamel mug strapped to the pack. Our supplies
      of all our needs, food ammunition water etc are carried by our B.ECHELON
      which is our supply organisation and has all the transport and essential
      supplies. So everything we need comes from there, naturally, the nearer
      they are to us, the easier and quicker the supplies get to us, so they
      can"t get too near the sharp end for obvious reasons. So if they were
      within reasonable distance from us, we sometimes got bread, but more
      often than not as we were mostly on the move, we had to have COMPO 
      rations. These came in wooden boxes roughly about a foot square. There
      were about 3 different kinds of contents, our favourite being an A BOX
      because it had the best selection of food. Each box contained 7 days
      ration for one man or 1 days rations for 7 men, each box contained
      cigarettes (mostly stolen before we got them !) Salt pepper, sugar, tea
      even toilet paper etc so we would have been happy with this arrangement
      if we were able to get our full number, but only too often, we  had to
      share lesser amounts and of course with these rations there was no bread,
      only hard biscuits, so that might enrich our diet!<br>
      Now we are forming up for an attack on a hilltop town called CENTURIPE. 
      This will be a BRIGADE attack with 3 battalions of infantry and support. 
      Our first glimpse of the town was a nightmare! Reminded us of one of
      those vampire films with the old house sitting on top the hill! Here we
      met the German Paratroopers who sure were tough nuts to dislodge!
      Eventually we did after suffering unbelievable number of casualties
      ourselves. Once we got into the town we were horrified to find the
      civilians in the most desperate plight you could imagine! The Germans
      (nice people really, so they tell me) had stripped the place bare after
      murdering hundreds in cold blood! Mostly women and children! We did what
      we could with our meager supplies, but they were only a drop in the ocean
      and we had to have armed guards to protect our medical supplies from
      their hands. Here, my sergeant in charge of our R.A.P. Regimental Aid
      Post, helped to deliver a baby, but  its life was to be short lived as
      the young mother had no milk, we found some powdered milk but the baby
      had passed away before we left. This was our really first experience of
      what war can do to a town,  everything in utter chaos, no services at
      all, everything sabotaged, water poisoned etc. This would all be put
      right by people eventually following up behind us, but God help these
      poor souls until then!<br>
      As you can imagine, we were not sorry to leave this sorry place, we moved
      onto attack a place called Mount Rivoglia, this was a horrific time, we
      had so many casualties we were forced to withdraw,  plus 10 lads taken
      prisoner! Then we took up positions on the slopes of Mount Etna, the
      volcano, a fighting patrol we sent out was ambushed and another 20 lads
      were taken prisoner! In 3 days we had lost 100 men! We were then taken
      out of the line to lick our wounds and  re-group. Whilst resting, the
      fighting in Sicily came to an abrupt end and we were moved to a lovely
      place on the coast named PATT?<br>

      Once again I am leaving a  theatre of war and leaving out  some 
      important  details,  during  one  our  many  skirmishes  where we
      suffered numerous casualties, our Regimental Aid Post was in a culvert
      under a road, this section suffered a heavy shelling, the other stretcher
      bearers and I were bringing our wounded to this area, so you can imagine
      the chaos! We were piling the dead in one area, the serious cases in
      another etc. We had one guy we had picked up with a really bad stomach
      wound with heavy internal bleeding that we were unable to stop. We
      thought he was dead and asked the doctor to come and verify. To our
      amazement the Doctor  refused to leave the Culvert! He had completely
      lost control and was blabbering like a baby, we reported this to an
      officer who came and led him away. This story gets significant later on
      in this story, so please remember it! Second point I forgot, because most
      of our Regimental Aid Station had been wiped out, I was now appointed to
      this task, this was great for me, here we were in a lovely house with all
      the amenities and helping to run a medical clinic! A new Doctor, very
      young and keen had been found from somewhere, the Sgt was still there and
      I had a great time dressing wounds, syringing ears etc and all the
      comforts of home! This only lasted for a couple of days, then I was
      called in front of our Company Commander! He informed me that the Mortar
      platoon had suffered heavy casualties among the carrier drivers owing to
      going up on mines, and as I had been trained as a carrier driver I was
      being transferred to the MORTAR PLATOON!  He said I would have a couple
      of days to familiarise myself  myself with the latest model of carrier
      before sailing to Italy! I was in total shock! I had to leave my cushy
      billet and report to my new Officer who incidentally was a SIR! SIR JOHN
      PRESTIGE in fact! A really nice guy, but more suited to the cocktail
      lounges of LONDON than this theatre of WAR! He promptly informed me that
      I would be his driver and our prime task would be to reccy for sites for
      our mortars and act as FORWARD OBSERVATION POST! Typical Army! First they
      had me as a Bren Gunner, then a stretcher bearer now a carrier driver
      because all the other poor buggers had been blown up! Thanks for nothing
      I thought. So I had to spend the next couple of days driving around like
      an idiot learning all the modifications that had been made to the
      carriers since my stint with them in the U.K.  Soon it was time to embark
      on the barges and were across the STRAIGHTS OF MASSINA to ITALY! What
      waits for us there we thought, we were soon to find out and if we had
      known what awaited us I'm sure we wouldn't have gone! It is now Sept21st
      I had my 20th birthday on hill 667 and had spent Xmas attacking GREEN
      HILL in Africa, Happy days!<br>

      We sailed from MILAZZO to TARANTO and landed with no opposition, Jerry
      having withdrawn, all our transport, lorries, guns &amp; our carriers
      etc, moved by road to REGGIO and concentrated in an area north of
      TARANTO. I have recently been sent some official notes of our actions in
      Italy but it would take hours of writing, so will just concentrate on the
      major actions as so much happier events happened to me after hostilities
      ended.  I'm sure you have read enough about blood and bullets, so will be
      brief. We were told we are to land at TERMOLI up the coast without
      support, i.e. no heavy guns or tanks etc. This was to try and cut off
      Jerry in his withdrawal. Unfortunately, Jerry knew better and overran our
      positions with TIGER tanks with the biggest gun you have ever seen and
      armoured cars of the 1st. PANZER DIVISION! We had to withdraw and hold on
      until our support arrived, it was pretty rough holding on but once our
      support arrived we pushed on, once again, heavy casualties. Finding it
      hard to find faces I know! No we have to do a night attack on another
      hilltop town. This time it is GUCLINIONESI. I'm mentioning place names
      here in case perhaps you might visit some of these places on holiday and
      you will get some idea of the terrain we were confronted with!<br>
      Here, we were relieved by the West Kents, After our encounter with the
      Tiger tanks with out support weapons, all Officers and N.C.OS had to
      learn to operate our 6 pounder guns! We were soon in action again, this
      meant a river crossing!<br>
      We were ordered to attack German positions south of SAM SALVO, here our
      C.O. was wounded and a company commander killed among others. Attack
      initially successful but later tanks overran our forward positions, we
      regrouped, made another assault and Jerry withdrew. We took 35 prisoners.
      Our casualties 60. It is now Nov. 6th. Daylight advance to town of
      CASALBORDINO, we entered the town as Jerry was leaving. We now advanced
      to the River Sangro, a place we will never forget, the weather was
      atrocious Heavy rain and high winds, absolutely no shelter, continually
      wet, cold and hungry, place -just a sea of mud, hardly any transport can
      move, lots of mules brought in. We were stuck here for 18days of pure
      misery! Lots of patrols, everyone having to go including drivers, we were
      so short of men by now, casualties were very bad, mostly on mines
      including 4 officers! As the rain subsided we managed to make a river
      crossing and after a huge barrage and air support, Jerry withdrew. We
      were taken out for refit an regroup to a place named CASTEL DE RIO, here
      for 5 lovely days to get dry and warm and have hot food etc. 14th. Dec
      now, 2 battalion attack on CARMAGGIO, held up by mud and strong enemy
      resistance, had to withdraw with heavy casualties. Moved to DICCOMANO for
      5 days Xmas celebrations, fantastic! 28th. Dec, once more into the
      breach! Now the weather is worse than anything I have encountered in
      CANADA! Heavy sleet and snow with temperatures well below freezing, this
      of course with no cover no extra clothing, not even a blanket at night!
      It was unbelievable, luckily Jerry was inactive also, except for heavy
      shelling, 20 casualties.<br>

      I am sorry I got the last page a little out of sequence, but will carry
      on,  I still have 3 full pages of details of all our actions to write
      which would take for ever, so I will Just throw in the most important and
      interesting ones, look at the date now, 1944.<br>
      It  is nearly 2 years that we have been constantly in action. We really
      are getting weary and down hearted!  Relieved by units of the 1st.
      CANADIAN DIV. Moved to a small village to REST? Where we were employed
      clearing heavy snow. Here we spent a really miserable Xmas. Moved into
      the front at ALTINO, both sides occupying widespread villages, lots of
      patrols etc, casualties again through mines etc. Here we teamed up with
      the ITALIAN PARTISANS commanded by a British MAJOR MIGRAM, In one of our
      raids the Major  was killed. Now we had to travel miles over to the
      Western sector to a place named MIGNANO, this was to be in preparation
      for taking over from the NEW ZEALANDERS at the dreaded MONTE CASSINO! We
      took up positions in the railway station and suffered very heavy
      casualties from enemy mortars, we actually had our mortar in an
      inspection pit used to maintain the trains. I will pause here to try and
      convey the picture we were greeted with, imagine driving down a highway
      to the foot of a mountain, turning left into a huge valley and seeing
      this MONASTERY looking down over you. I have pictures taken on our
      reunion there and it is beyond belief that any one could ever take it
      believe me! To counter the fact that we were under constant observation,
      many large smoke generators were deployed in the valley which did give us
      some form of privacy! Unfortunately,  as we were directly below the
      Monastery, they could in fact actually throw bombs down on us, and they
      did!<br>
      It  is really hard to put  into words the absolute horror of this place!
      The town itself had been laid flat by continuous bombing by the Yanks,
      and we also got some left overs from them! This meant that nothing could
      move in the town as everywhere and everything was in total  ruins and
      bomb craters. If you happen to see a picture of the this, you will notice
      beneath the Monastery, there is a CASTLE, that is where our positions
      were, it was so bad there, we had to be relieved every 2 days , the mind
      and body could not stand anymore than that. Rotting corpses everywhere,
      no chance of burying them on the side of a mountain l'm afraid. Constant
      heavy machine gun fire and mortars made our life a living Hell! It was
      here that I slung a track on my carrier along the mad mile, a shell
      dropped in front of me,  I swerved to avoid the crater and went into a
      ditch! Nothing to do but have a fag and wait for someone to pull me out!
      Gave message to passing lorry and waited. The wind came up and blew the
      smoke away and left me sitting there for Jerry to have target practice at
      me! This was really scary and I lay right under the carrier and could
      hear the stuff hitting it as I tried to bury myself in the ground!
      Eventually the smoke came back and soon after, a Light Aid Detachment
      with a Schammel breakdown truck pulled me out. It was then that I
      realised I had just been and picked up a hundred mortar bombs for our
      mortar, and what a blast that would have made it Jerry had hit them!<br>
      After a huge barrage and air attacks, a mass attack was started. It  is
      hard to put  into words the utter chaos that ensued!  After suffering
      unbelievable casualties we broke through, mainly due to the fantastic job
      the Polish contingent did in taking the actual Monastery!. At last we
      were out of that terrible situation in the valley, now Jerry was really
      on the run! He was retreating so fast, we couldn't keep up with him! Now
      we stop to regroup, stock up with ammo and gas etc. and try and get a
      meal if possible. It was here that I had a humorous incident, not too
      many of those to report! Whilst enjoying our meal and sorting ourselves
      out after the horrors of CASSINO, we were shaken out of our complacency
      by very heavy shelling, big stuff! Time to get out of here sharpish!<br>
      Jump in the carrier, battery flat! Now in those days we didn't have the
      luxury of alternators, only dynamos which were not very efficient, so
      this often occurred and for these occasions we carried a starting handle.
      This was about  6 ft long if you can believe it! Well, trying to thread
      this 6 ft rod through the front of the driving compartment into the back
      of the carrier where the large engine is situated is no mean feat under
      ideal  conditions. Here it was sheer panic, I should mention here that by
      now I had lost my Officer as he had found a JEEP so I was now a Mortar
      carrier driver with a crew. I was having a real tough Job trying to
      thread this bloody thing through and I heard Archie one of the crew,
      shout out.. WHAT THE BLOODY HELL YOU DOING! LETS GET OUT OF HERE! Well I
      looked up to give him a mouthful and saw he had a biscuit tin on his
      head! Apparently, he had lost his steel helmet in the attack! I Just
      rolled up!  Got it started and we were on our way again!  I still have a
      laugh now when I think of it! I would like to relate here the difference
      between the actions of Jerry and ourselves.  Jerry had the luxury of
      taking anything he wanted and putting real terror into the civilian
      population by mass killing and what they didn't need they destroyed, we
      on the other hand had to behave as AMBASSADORS of Britain! No looting or
      raping! Raping was not our concern as we seldom saw any females and the
      ones we did see were decidedly friendly! Looting was another matter
      however, and we helped ourselves to most anything we could find that
      would make our lives a little more comfortable. So it was not uncommon to
      see squaddies in all sorts of attire! As for my carrier it was a sight to
      behold! All sorts of regalia adorned it! Anything for a laugh! Hats,
      ladies underwear, bells, hooters etc etc .These were immediately
      confiscated when we had an inspection during rest periods etc. Once we
      had a real shock, they really gave us a shakedown and took away our store
      of German weapons we had, LUGERS. MAUSERS etc. we were sick as these were
      our stock<br>
      for selling to the Yanks when we met up. This is where I went out of
      .sequence, so I'll carry on regardless, it is now MAY-JUNE 1944 and we
      eventually meet up with the main German force at a place named AQUINO,
      this was a tough one, our Commanding Officer was killed here, second one
      we've lost, must be getting careless!<br>

      I will have to brief now, enemy has retreated north of ROME declaring it
      an "OPEN CITY! Took over positions at CITTA DELLA PIEVE, enemy still held
      part of the village! FUN! Enemy once again moved north, Into action again
      at STRADA. Relieved by 1<sup>st</sup>. Div. And moved to reserve area for
      regrouping etc. Once more into the breach! On to LAKE TRASIMINO and
      advanced after successful attack to CASTIGLIONE DEL LAGO, advancing
      against decreasing resistance, Eventually pursuit abandoned near
      CORTINA.Relievd by units of the ARMOURED BRIGADE. Move back to TIVOLI,
      east of ROME for rest etc. Here we had 5 day's  leave in  ROME! What a
      time we had, stacks  of money to spend as we'd had no chance to spend
      any. Of course our friends the YANKS made things tough for us because
      everything was based on their dollar. CHAPS like me who earned the grand
      total of 10  shillings a week out of which I had to allot 3 shillings a
      week to my dear old mum couldn't compete with them, so we had to rely on
      our charm, but we did o.k. and it was a fantastic 5 day's.<br>
      Now we were told the incredible news that we were being shipped to EGYPT!
      We couldn't believe it! We went by rail to TARANTO passing many of our
      battlefields where we had left some really great blokes. So in a
      wonderful happy and delirious mood we sailed for PORT SAID.We eventually
      arrived at a tented camp in the desert at a place named QUASSASIN  It was
      so eerie to be in the quiet and peace of the desert, no guns, no Jerries,
      wonderful food and sleep peacefully in a bed with sheets and all the
      comforts of home! Unbelievable bliss, we were told we would be here for
      six weeks and during that time we would have 5 days leave in CAIRO or
      ALEXANDRIA! My mates and I chose CAIRO and we had a whale of a time!
      Unfortunately we got caught up in a really nasty riot between different
      units, some foreign and it was an almighty shindig, this as though we
      hadn't had enough fighting!<br>
            This six weeks soon flew by and after endless parades and training,
      plus getting large numbers of reinforcements. Sadly they comprised of 
      guys from units who had experienced really cushy billets in non combat
      areas, so were completely demoralized to be joining a front line combat
      unit and it was to show when we returned to the fray! So now we returned
      to Italy and the horrors of war again! Now we are moving up preparing to
      attack BOLOGNA., We are now into extreme winter conditions, snow and cold
      like you wouldn't believe, we held incredible positions on a mountain
      named GRANDE SPIDORA and I can tell you, there was nothing GRAND about
      it! These were about the worst conditions any human could endure! No
      transport could move,  every one had to do their stint whatever their
      job, as a rifleman, doing patrols etc. We managed to rig up a small tent
      in the snow and eventually they did find us a few blankets that soon were
      soaking wet, we had to stay up there a day and a night and during that
      time had to do a listening patrol and a fighting patrol! They issued us
      with leather jerkings and for patrols we had white suits, these became a
      damned nuisance, after sitting in them for a while, our sweat froze and
      when we moved it sounded like bells ringing and drew fire on us!<br>
      I  would  like to dwell on this awful experience on this mountain, named
      GRANDE SPIDORA, this may not be read in history books but I can assure
      you it was one of the worst experiences of utter misery, despair and
      complete hopelessness we had to endure! At this time, we were so short of
      men it was almost impossible to act as a unit. We moved as far as we
      could with our transport to the base of the mountain. The weather was
      unbelievably cold, snow drifts about 10ft. High..Wind blowing at gale
      force. Here we had to leave all our transport, even our carriers and
      Jeeps. From here we had to use Mules as far as they could go. Terrain got
      so bad we had to abandon them also! Here I should pause and say how I
      sometimes wish I could have had some of my Canadian friends with me
      during this period to let them know that other countries have snow and we
      didn't have the comforts of home, no roads, nowhere to shelter and nearly
      always short of food etc. I know I keep repeating about how I would like
      my Canadian friends to realise all about the snow etc, but it does get a
      bit irksome sometimes when I have to  listen to the stories of snow and
      cold and  specially about driving in the snow!<br>
            Because of our man shortage, everyone had to be a rifleman, cooks,
      drivers, everyone! Absolutely no sign of any habitation or life for miles
      except an old abandoned hut about a mile from where we left the mules.
      Here the main body stayed in reserve finding what cover they could, they
      did find a few small tents on one of the mules which were a Godsend! I
      was on the first party to climb the mountain to find a  place overlooking
      the valley, remember the snow was up to our waist, sometimes I have to
      bite my tongue when the Canadians here talk about the snow on the
      prairies and out East etc There were 10 of us I remember and we had 3- 
      2man bivouacs between us, some bright specimen had left the blankets on
      the transport miles away!<br>
            So we dug into the snow and rigged up the bivouacs just below the
      ridge and did our best to keep out of the blinding snow storm that was
      raging. They did give us a water bottle full of rum and a corn beef
      sandwich after telling us that was the best they could find! We had
      orders to stay there for 24 hours and then we would be relieved if
      possible! Thank you very much we said, or words to that effect! Then we
      were politely informed that we were not up there for the benefit of our
      health but we had a job to do! JOB! We could hardly stand up, let alone
      do anything or go anywhere! So now we are told that our mission up there
      was to have a listening patrol and a fighting patrol to get
      prisoners!<br>
      What bright spark miles behind the lines thought up this magical gem we
      thought, irony of this was, they forgot to give us blankets and food, but
      had remembered to bring along WHITE CAMOUFLAGE SUITS! These obviously
      were meant to be used on our patrols! Our first patrol was to be for
      observation (couldn't see your hand in front of your face!) If you had
      moved 5 yards away from one another you'd have been lost forever! So we
      just sat there like dummies, frozen to the bone, couldn't smoke, or do
      anything except try to huddle together to get some warmth from one
      another! Back we go to our 2 man bivvy, the 3 of us huddled together. 
       This we carried on, 2 hours on patrol, 4 off for 24 hours! Will not
      enlarge on one of our fighting patrols as that would take a whole book in
      itself.  Let me just say it was one of the most frightening experiences
      unlike anything we had ever encountered  before.  We took a few
      prisoners. So we managed with great difficulty through a snow blizzard
      and skin biting wind to find our little SHANGRI-LA at the bottom of the
      mountain. This was in reality an old cattle shed. Here we were issued
      with a hot cup of tea &amp; a bully beef sandwich which was very much the
      worse for wear. We were also given a  tin of water and a can of petrol,
      this to  make a small fire.. This was meant for washing &amp; shaving (an
      order!) And washing our socks and feet.  Can you imagine this among 10
      men! The Jerries of course had been marched back to the comfort of the
      base! After this Royal treatment we were inspected to see if we had
      shaved etc then told to get some rest! So this might give you some idea
      of the glamourous life of an INFANTRYMAN! We actually thought we were the
      lowest form of life and treated as such!<br>
            So after a week of this nightmare, we were marched out to waiting
      transport 5 hours away and then to a rest area to rest and regroup. When
      we arrived, we couldn't believe our eyes! We were in a large area full of
      self propelled guns! Believe it or not, they were in ACTION actually
      firing and this was to be our rest area! Now the rain is absolutely
      belting down, we are told to dig in. All around us was the cases from the
      shells that had been fired, so we picked up as many as could and made
      make shift covers etc. Of course everywhere we stopped we had to dig a
      latrine trench, this was a long trench with a pole suspended above! I
      Will spare the more sensitive readers the sordid details of this delicate
      operation, but when you think we had to bear our backsides in about 14
      degrees below, we did not linger and read a book, that's for sure. Soon
      we were on the move again, moving up at night to take over a position
      from some other unit<br>
      By this time of course, dates become confused, but Italy had slung
      MUSSOLINI out and they had left the AXIS powers. So now we had all sorts
      of freedom fighters roaming about and expecting us to feed them etc. They
      were a damn nuisance to us, but hopefully they might be troublesome to
      Jerry as well. By this time Jerry was really on the run, the second front
      had started so the Germans were getting really stretched now, but because
      of the very unfriendly terrain we had to encounter, deep valleys,
      mountains with villages resting high up the slopes, Jerry always had the
      advantage over us, seeing us advance all the way in daylight etc. Plus
      always having been where we were, he had the perfect range set for
      shelling us and making life very  uncomfortable for us and never being
      able  to relax for a minute.<br>
      After a few days in this position, we were on the move again and at this
      time I was driving my Bren Gun Carrier, which as you may know is a
      tracked vehicle, these are very close to the ground and our biggest fear
      was TELLER MINES! These were a terrible thing to meet, our only
      protection...was a few sandbags on the floor, the Jerries did not always
      have time to lay mines on the road as they needed the roads for a speedy
      withdrawal. So do we take a chance and take the road, or go off the road
      and chance the fields which also could be mined! We  were moving along
      this road in a valley knowing that  Jerry could see us from his high 
      lookouts on the mountains ahead of us quite close....A Shell explodes in
      front of us, me being the leading carrier caught the lot! I was knocked
      unconscious, the carrier was turned over and looked like a scrap of old
      junk, I came to, felt all around me, could feel everything in place, arms
      legs hands etc but a terrific pain in my left leg, the one I had T.B.
      when a baby. Next thing I know I am in a JEEP ambulance and was taken to
      a SOUTH AFRICAN ADVANCED DRESSING STATION.<br>
      I had no idea then what had happened to the rest of the crew, but found
      out a long time afterwards that one guy had been killed and the others,
      severely wounded. Sad to say, I was never to see these guys again! Was
      examined by Doctor who told me my left leg was very swollen and I was
      being evacuated by air to NAPLES! I was in a lot of pain and asked if
      there was a wound of any kind and was surprised to learn there was none!
      So why would they fly me to NAPLES because my leg was swollen I asked
      myself? Doctors said they think the blow to my leg had started up the
      T.B. again and were treating it as such, so now I am out of action. By
      this time I was mobile with a crutch and as they had seen by my record
      that I had been a stretcher bearer for a month through the Sicilian
      campaign, they were giving me  little jobs around the ward, shaving
      people prior to operations and generally helping the nurses and some
      lovely ITALIAN NUNS who were priceless! Then one day a different Doctor
      came to see me, &amp; here I will test your memory. Remember me telling
      you about our Doctor in SICILY refusing to come and see one of our
      patients to certify he was dead, and he refused? He was shaking with
      fear? Well this was he. He instantly recognised me! and asked me a few
      questions about our unit, names of officers etc and politely tried to
      edge away from the obvious incident concerning him. After examining me
      with lots of silence, he looked me straight in the eyes and said, " YOU
      DON'T WANT TO GO BACK UP THERE DO YOU?" "Not if I can help it!" I said.
      "O.K. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO!" and he was gone and I never ever saw him
      again! All though the thought ran through my mind that the war might be
      over for me, there was this funny feeling running through my mind, what's
      going to happen to all my mates I've left up there? I tried to dismiss
      the feelings of guilt at leaving them but came to the conclusion they
      would all do the same under these same circumstances.  I quickly made up
      my mind to accept what fate had decided and go with the flow. It is an
      amazing thing about service life, one becomes extremely close to one
      another in a very intimate close way, just like a family, then you are
      transferred to another unit or even another section of your Regiment and
      you have to start all over again forming friendships. This either helps
      to develop your personality or makes a moron out of you! So now I had
      settled into a new kind of life with lots of discipline in the Hospital
      as expected. The food was great, the beds, imagine actually sleeping in a
      bed with clean sheets after living like an animal for the last 3 years,
      plus the nurses were fantastic but untouchable, they all wanted the
      officers, not other ranks such as us! Soon I was off the crutches and
      able to go to town with a pass! The only snag was, we had to wear
      HOSPITAL BLUES! This consisted of a Royal blue jacket &amp; trousers
      which I'm sure came from the CRIMEAN WAR! You cannot imagine anything
      less glamorous in your life! Severely cut single breasted jacket,
      trousers like drain pipes and a regulation shoe. With this, you wore a
      white shirt &amp; red tie! Took a lot of guts to actually go out pass the
      hospital gate into town I can tell you! To add to our woes, NAPLES was
      suffering from a TYPHUS epidemic and fraternizing with the civilian
      population was banned as was eating or drinking in bars etc. Now the
      heads of our Forces, as though they didn't have anything better to do,
      had decided to take over all the opera houses for use by the services. We
      were allowed to take a female or male, though no GAY BRIGADE I'm pleased
      to say had  appeared yet!<br>
      So now we had the amazing spectacles of pig ignorant soldiers who could
      hardly read or write let alone enjoying the music of VERDI etc, going to
      the opera with an Italian chic on his arm. This was even more ironic
      seeing the sqauddies were  dressed like  clowns in the circus! OH! Happy
      Days! I'M not trying to impress anyone here of my intellect or superior
      position in life, but I had been brought up with good music, specially
      Opera as both my Father and my eldest sister and her husband were avid
      opera and classical music fans. Happily this was to be a wonderful
      experience for me, I can't speak for my female companion who seemed to be
      crying all through the opera. I was never sure if the Opera moved her or
      perhaps me in my BLUES! Just savour the scene, here we were, in the world
      famous SAN CARLO OPERA HOUSE in NAPLES! A poor boy from London enjoying a
      famous opera in one of the Worlds foremost Opera Houses! The Opera
      incidentally was RIGOLLETO where the hunchback father pays a professional
      killer to murder the DUKE for seducing his daughter. There is  is an
      amazing scene at midnight when he meets the murderer to pay him for his
      evil deed and collect the body of the Duke. He pays the guy, takes the
      sack, opens it and lo &amp; behold, instead of the DUKE, the body of his
      sweet daughter greets him! Well! The atmosphere, illusion, incredible
      singing and the fantastic music just blows your mind. I would just like
      to add before leaving this episode that later on,, I was even luckier to
      go to the LA SCALA in MILAN. Unbelievable!<br>
      <br>
      Soon we were to hear the wonderful news that Jerry had surrendered and
      the war for us was over though the Japs were still fighting. This soon
      dispelled any feelings I may have felt at leaving my mates back up the
      front and I was ready to take life by the throat and really enjoy myself!
      I was still in my Hospital Blues but had come to terms with that and life
      was good. Naples was a real hot bed of BLACK MARKET, there wasn't a thing
      you couldn't buy or barter. Naples being a huge port, was a huge dumping
      ground for supplies to the American &amp; Allied forces, so thieving was
      a huge business and who better masters than the NEAPOLITANS with their
      MAFFIA connections! There was a huge hill leading out of Naples and it
      was common for allied lorries full of food equipment, clothes etc to
      start climbing the hill and be empty by the time it had reached the top.
      My only regret is that during my brief stay there, SOPHIA LOREN, in my
      opinion, the sexiest woman in the world, even now, was walking along the
      same streets as me and I didn't meet her! When I was injured I omitted to
      say I had a tooth knocked out and here was a heaven sent chance to get
      one. I went to a Dentist and he made me a plate with one front tooth on
      for 2 packets of PLAYERS MEDIUM cigarettes, worth a fortune there!<br>
      All good times come to an end and my wonderful stay in NAPLES had come to
      an end, I really had a great time there seeing all the sights, ruins of
      POMPEII etc. I learned that I had been medically downgraded from A.1 To
      C.3 and would be sent to REHABILITATION CENTER for JOB ASSESSMENT. A few
      other guys and myself were fitted out in new uniforms etc, bundled onto a
      truck and driven to the outskirts of Naples to a huge ARMY CAMP. Here
      life was pretty awful, all the dregs, wasters, misfits, duckers &amp;
      divers, scroungers etc were to be found. Luckily my stay there was short
      &amp; sweet., I passed a tough driving test on all sorts of trucks and
      tracked vehicles and learnt that I was being sent to BOLOGNA where a
      VEHICLE PARK was operating. The outcome was, I was transferred to the
      R.A.O.C. ROYAL ORDINANCE CORP. I felt very sad at leaving the "BUFFS
      because it was such a special mob and it meant something to be a part of
      them, but life goes on and we all have to make and under go changes in
      our lives. Hello Bologna! A Lovely city and we were stationed right in
      the middle of the race track which in normal times was a horse trotting
      race course.<br>
            It was soon apparent that ex Infantrymen had more in common than
      guys from non combat units and I teemed up with a smashing Scottish guy
      from THE SEAFORTH HIGHLANDERS and we became firm friends. Our main task
      was sorting and moving the hundreds of trucks etc that were being brought
      in from various battlefront in all states of. Condition. As winter was
      drawing near, the first priority was to ensure them against the winter,
      we found a wonderful way of starting these trucks that had been laying
      idle for months. We'd attach a tow rope, one guy in the truck, another
      guy on the mudguard with the bonnet open, take the air filter off the
      carb, get moving with the driver putting it in 3<sup>rd</sup>. gear, guy
      on the mud guard pouring petrol into the carb and 9 times out of 10 it
      would splutter into life! Working and living among any form of transport
      with access to petrol tyres, spare parts etc was like living in a dream
      world! It may seem awful to you people reading this but you have to
      remember what we had been through and this was our chance to make good
      and earn a few bob and boy did we do good! Can't recall how long we
      stayed there but we all enjoyed it very much. Soon we were off again,
      this time to MILAN in Northen Italy. This time we were taking over the
      famous MONZA RACE TRACK which is still used in the GRAND PRIX RACES
      TODAY. What a place MILAN was, a really beautiful city, at first we were
      under canvas until workmen could finish renovating the grandstand for our
      accommodation. This was to be the highlight of our Army life, we had
      everything we could wish for, we even started a fabulous soccer team and
      had some great times with the locals. We were very popular with the
      locals as many of both sexes found good jobs here.<br>

      Monza<br>

    <p align="left">
      Monza was a fascinating place, the race track is huge and fortunately was
      still in good shape, we had literally thousands of trucks etc parked in
      every conceivable spare place leaving the old race track to get about and
      do our work starting and parking the trucks in their classes. Obviously
      for youngsters like us having been through war, this was like a holiday
      with pay! Everyone, and I mean everyone, including the officers had a
      fiddle going, maybe a can of gas, a tyre or spare part, everyone was
      feathering their nest, very little discipline, no guard duties, no dress
      code, in fact just like civvy st going to work and lots of free time. One
      very interesting job that came our way was to take 6 German prisoners in
      a big truck with all our food and sleeping gear etc down south to a well
      known place named BARI on the coast, here we had to pick up some American
      INTERNATIONAL trucks with the Germans driving them and 2 of us escorting
      them, we expected trouble with them but the only trouble we had was from
      the Italian people who wanted to lynch them so we had to be careful where
      we stopped. We did this for about a month and made some money bringing
      olive oil from Barry and selling it in Milan to a Nightclub we used to
      use.<br>
            The purpose for this MONZA operation was, Milan &amp; Turin were
      both huge manufacturers of cars and trucks &amp; as most of the railway
      system had been destroyed, the idea was to get as many trucks mended and
      back on the road, by this time MARSHALL AID from America was arriving
      with food &amp; supplies for the Italian population who were really
      starving, no power or water, no medical supplies etc. So these huge
      factories were working hard getting these trucks etc. on the road to get
      supplies moving across the country. Eventually we did get a railway line
      linked to a place outside of Milan named SESTO-SAN-GIOVANNI. This is the
      place incidentally where the Italian Partisans hung MUSSOLINI his
      mistress CLARA PUTACCI and a couple of other men on the rafters of a
      garage there. I actually have a photo of them hanging after they were
      killed and mutilated. I should add here that we also visited the house
      where Mussolini was murdered at a lovely place a couple of hours away
      named LAKE COMO, more about this place later.<br>
            Once we got the rail line, we were getting trucks coming up on flat
      bed railway trucks, we had a COLE CRANE mounted on a 3 ton lorry and we
      had to learn how to use it to lift the trucks off.  I had a huge American
      DIAMOND T, I have a photo somewhere with me driving it. I used to have 12
      German prisoners of war driving 12 trucks on loose tow ropes from there
      to MONZA, sounds amazing but of course there was little or no traffic on
      the road so it was quite easy in fact, so this is how we spent our day
      time..My pal and I were introduced to a couple who owned a bar in a small
      village outside of Milan, they were half English, I never did find out
      which half. They were brother &amp; sister and a real couple of survivors
      who had obviously prospered during the GERMAN OCCUPATION you could say!
      After feasting us and giving us a great time with beautiful meals and the
      best of wines etc! The etc covers a multitude of sins I might add! They 
       got round to what their main reason for cultivating us was. They wanted
      us to be their suppliers of goods that some business men in the
      surrounding area required. Couldn't have asked 2 better blokes! We did
      very well with them and then they asked for the ultimate! Recall I told
      you that the base employed hundreds of local labour? Well obviously these
      people knew what was going on there and everything that was available.
      They were very hesitant about making this request that seemed so
      important to them, obviously some big noise had told them to try. Well
      what they wanted was a 40 foot trailer with 24 wheels!  Can you imagine!
      Well my  mate and I, went back to base and considered all the angles, we
      done a recce and found a way we would get it out if we could move a
      couple of trucks out the way, this we did and left them for a couple of
      days to see if anyone had noticed and decided we would go for it! I got
      the big Diamond T, hooked up the trailer, my mate went in front to see if
      the road out was clear and we were off and running! We had already sussed
      out the place to deliver it to, it was a bit tight and I knew we would
      have to unhitch the trailer and push it up this narrow alley, this we
      accomplished, got paid millions of lire and we were off back to base.
      Days went by, not a word was said, no one could have seen us, we were
      very careful not to say a word to anyone, only problem was,  the money!
      We had wads of it! I actually had a beautiful suit made, beautiful shoes
      shirt etc and I also bought a   BERETTA revolver. Now if all this sounds
      like a FAIRY STORY, believe me, I could make up better stories than this,
      every word is true and I sit here sometimes and think about those days
      and I shudder at some of the capers we got up to. So life was good and we
      really were living it up!   Sometime later, I learnt that I had been
      picked to GO HOME ON LEAVE! I had been away now for nearly 4 years and
      the thought of going home was unbelievable. This didn't give me much time
      to prepare, I managed to buy every member of my immediate family a
      present, money was no object! I bought dozens of pairs of NYLON
      STOCKINGS, unheard of at home in those dark days. Remember me telling you
      about my mate back home when we were stationed on MANSTON AIRPORT
      suggesting I write to his sister who was really good looking and she
      might send me food parcels and fags? Well I did, and we carried on
      corresponding right through the war! So this was to be the first time I
      had seen her since she had seen me off on my embarkation leave! My only
      worry was, how am I going to get through Customs with all the presents in
      my kit bag? You just can't believe that the Customs would stop us with
      all we had been through could you?  But they did! I was very lucky,  they
      stopped the guy in front of me who was gutted, I was through and running!
      I should pause here and talk about the train trip home, it was quite well
      organised by the Army, We boarded the train in MILAN which took us
      through the SIMPLON TUNNEL that divides ITALY from SWITZERLAND, we
      stopped in LUCERNE where food and hot drinks etc were laid on, same in
      PARIS where a couple of the lads fancied spending time there rather than
      in HACKNEY!  Can you blame them? Then onto the Ferry to DOVER where we
      were given tickets to our final destination. From here I got a fast train
      to BROMLEY SOUTH, then a cab to KENT HOUSE LANE! Here the story gets
      depressing because after the excitement of meeting my dear old MUM who
      was too full up to enjoy the moment and the presents I had brought for
      her. Had to tell me that there wasn't any bed for me! When I was home
      before joining the Army, we had suffered severe damage to our house
      caused by a LANDMINE that landed at the bottom of FRANKLIN ROAD very near
      to MAPLE road and the area was devastated!  My    sister,  husband and 2
      daughters actually lived in a block of flats on the corner of FRANKLIN
      &amp; MAPLE ROAD which also was severely damaged, While I was abroad,
      they both became   uninhabitable and by a sheer piece of luck they heard
      of a house for rent in KENT HOUSE LANE where the occupants had packed up
      and gone to dear old CANADA can you believe? You know the houses there
      Roger there were only 2 bedrooms and a small box room which Mum had, the
      2 young girls, Pat &amp; Janet had the other and of course my Sister Win
      &amp; her Husband Ted had the big bedroom. So as you can imagine it was
      not a very nice prospect. Naturally my poor old Mum was so upset, but
      what could she do?  Thousands of guys coming back from the war had to
      face the same thing. I consoled my mum and told her I could kip on the
      floor no problem, which I did. Next day I was off to see my girl friend
      in Edmonton, YOUR MUM incidentally! Well obviously I was captivated by
      the beauty of her and not having known her very much, only a brief visit
      on embarkation leave etc. This was a very special time. Her house, built
      in the late 20's perhaps was quite a nice house on the corner, she lived
      there with2  sisters, a brother and her Dad, her Mum having passed on.
      After hearing of my predicament at my sisters with no room for me, her
      Dad said I could stay there as long as I wanted but would have to sleep
      with him! This wasn't ideal but as it would save me the awful journey of
      train from Penge West to London Bridge, bus to Liverpool St then  Bus to
      Edmonton, even this arrangement sounded good! So during this 2 weeks I
      did manage to spend some time with my poor old Mum, she was very
      understanding about the situation and I had a good leave after meeting
      all the rest of my family. Soon it was time to return to Italy,
      incidentally We did get engaged while I was home! A few weeks later I was
      sent for, told that as my last job on my record was as a LIFT FITTERS
      MATE (which it was!) The powers that be in their wisdom, thought I was
      just the sort of bloke England needed to get the country back on its
      feet!<br>
      Off back to Blighty, got demobbed, went to my old Firm I had worked for
      on the lifts, wasn't greeted to warmly by an old manager, gave me a note
      to travel to WATFORD to the EVER READY BATTERY COMPANY for a job.
      Arrived, asked where the lift workers were, asked me if I was IRISH!
      Turned out it was all on one floor, the only workers there were taking
      black out paper off of the glass roof! Told the foreman it wasn't for me,
      went back to  the firm, told them, was given a rocket about blokes coming
      back from the war and expecting cushy jobs etc. I exploded, gave him a
      mouthful and stormed out! Went back to Edmonton and continued the same
      arrangement, going home for weekends and staying at the little Kent House
      Hotel for bed &amp; breakfast when visiting my Mum. Eventually I was
      called back by the Army because I hadn't taken out the job I had been
      sent to! Luckily I was posted to a nice spot near SEVEN OAKS. The
      barracks were situated in MONTREAL PARK which is situated on the road 
      from DUNTON GREEN TO WESTERHAM. This was the birth place of GENERAL WOLF,
      of Canada fame! Not a lot of people know that (or care!). So now I was
      back in the mob again, our work place was in KNOWLE PARK which is a very
      interesting place. It was owned by a LORD CHATFIELD, it had all the
      characteristics of a calender, for instance, it had 365 rooms, 52
      corridors, 7 staircases etc. The Army had a huge vehicle park there with
      hundreds of different vehicles, the work was very interesting as our job
      was to prepare all these trucks, cars, and tracked vehicles for public
      auction.  By this time, your Mum and I were married, had no home so I
      brought her  to Seven Oaks &amp; found lodgings in the High st next to
      the post office opposite the College. This is where a detachment of
      A.T.S  WOMEN'S ARMY!) Were billeted, these same girls were our drivers at
      Knowle Park and about 12 of them came to London for our wedding. This was
      a tough time because the winter of 1947 was a real bad one. Everyone
      suffered, we were still on strict rations, because of the harsh
      conditions, coal was unavailable, everyone was freezing. A really tough
      time for one and all! To make matters worse, Mum became pregnant with
      Ray. Naturally she wanted to be back in London to get the best for
      herself and the baby. So she went back to her family and I used to go
      back when I could. A really miserable time for us both, but millions were
      all in the same boat except the civvies who stayed home, and made
      fortunes! Then out of the blue, my brother Ben who lived in Peckham in
      GAUTRY ROAD off of NUNHEAD LANE, offered us a basement room in the bottom
      half of a house they had there. We were very grateful and accepted the
      offer, cannot remember if Ray was born there or how long we stayed there,
      eventually Peckham Council found out Ben had lodgers which was against
      the law and we had to get out! In desperation I went to PENGE COUNCIL,
      they were very sympathetic but as PENGE took a real pasting during the
      war, they could only offer us a NISSEN HUT in WORDSWORTH ROAD. This was
      like Heaven after all we had been through to have a place of our own and
      be together for the first time. As I said, these were extremely tough
      times, the Nissen hut was terrible during this tough winter, we found
      mould under the beds, almost impossible to get any coal, coke or wood for
      the fire, it was amazing how your mum managed to keep us all healthy and
      alive! Once again my memory cannot recall how long we were there, but I'm
      sure Roger was born there, Richard was  born when we moved TRENHOLME.<br>
      So, after the horrors of the Nissen Hut, we were given a brand spanking
      new Maisonette, complete with BATHROOM! What luxury, Mum soon made a
      really comfortable home for us there and we were reasonably happy there
      considering the funny neighbours  we had upstairs! Here we stayed until
      poor Mum's illness. Then life became very miserable and you all know the
      outcome of that saga. Well folks, that's about all I intend to write
      here, I hope you have some idea of the war years as it is so difficult to
      write about something so horrific and traumatic. The utter senseless loss
      of life, so many millions of people, civilians as well as military,
      suffering untold injuries and depravation, for what I ask? Now we are
      being asked to change our lifestyle, lose all our traditions by the
      bloody Germans &amp; French. The slant eyed Japanese have been allowed to
      ruin our car and motorbike industries as have the Germans!  Now after
      murdering thousands of innocent people, mostly women &amp; children, the
      Irish have been accepted as equals! No wonder people wanted to
      emigrate!<br>
                My only hope is that there will never be another war involving
      us, if there is for God sake never let any of your sons join the
      INFANTRY!!!!<br>
