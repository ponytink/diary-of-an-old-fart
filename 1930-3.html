          Above is the Christmas card sent out by my Mum and Dad in 1939. - Me
          reading the news. As a baby, Mum and Dad were very proud of their
          'new addition' and in recognition of his arrival produced a Christmas
          card commemorating his arrival! Unlike me, said to be just like my
          father, he was a true Hussey! blonde hair blue eyes and the longest
          dark eye lashes ever seen in downtown West Wickham.<br>

          Here is John in the back garden of 49 Cuxton Road, Strood.
          On leave from his RAF days at RAF Halton. <br> To the right, JFP is
          celebrating one of his many birthdays!. (He had probably had about 62
          by this time.)
          We were all at an OLD BEN Christmas party for the "Dicken's"
          committee and it coincided with his birthday.<br>By this time he had
          grown from what you see above, through WWII, left Woodlands Road
          school Gillingham to enter the RAF at Halton as an apprentice engine
          fitter, first on Hawker Hunters and ending up with treble one
          squadron and the world renowned 'Lightning' Seeing the world, and
          finishing working in the news trade in our family business.
