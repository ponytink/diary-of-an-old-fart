      I was easily led in those days! - It all started with a rep named Tony
      Woods calling at the warehouse. (He was not a newspaper rep.) and asking
      me if I would like to have a try at motor racing. There were week-end
      courses available at Snetterton for &#163;25 where you got to drive a formula
      ? car after a days instruction etc., but as it turned out the company had
      gone broke, so that was that! The next time I saw him, he said Oh!- I go
      flying now. He had joined the Allouette Flying Club at Biggin Hill. He
      said he could fix it for me to have a free trial flight etc., etc., and
      on the following Wednesday I duly met him there.<br>
      <br>
      The Allouette Flying Club was a little brick built 'shed' left over from
      WWII I imagine. It had tea making facilities and allegedly an Auster
      Taylorcraft aeroplane that was no where to be seen. It had gone to Le
      Touquet the previous Sunday, the instructor having taken some one's wife
      for a day's shopping and the weather/ engine or what ever had caused them
      to be stranded. That was their story anyway!<br>
      <br>
      It seemed from then on flying consisted more of talking about it than
      actually doing it! After endless cups of tea I finally arrived home
      around midnight to a very anxious Mavis, who had phoned my Mum, all the
      hospitals etc., (We didn't have mobiles in those days!) I did manage my
      free flight. They collared some llittle fellow who was just about to go
      up in an Auster belonging to the South London Flying Club and he said OK
      you can come with me.....<br>
      <br>
      They never let on that it was his first flight having just acquired a PPL
      (Private Pilot's Licence). Well it went up smoothly enough and we buzzed
      around here and there until the weather seemed to worsen a little. He
      said "we had better head back to Biggin" and with that he turned the
      thing around and we headed back. (?) After a while he said "I think we
      are lost, - Oh! There's another plane, we can follow him!"<br>
      <br>
      Some hopes. By the time he'd angled the plane around there was no sign of
      the other chap. Oh! he said "There's a train station we can go down and
      read the name off the platform signs." - again some hopes!! I asked if he
      had a map, and he had, so I opened it up and had a decko. Then he said
      "There is a pretty big town down there, it could be Tonbridge." a minute
      or so later he said "I know where we are" and directly below us was the
      Thames and King George IV Docks near Greenwich. He said he had set the
      compass arse about face and had been flying north when he had meant to
      fly south!!<br>
      <br>
      He duly set the compass correctly and headed due south. After a few
      minutes I spotted what appeared to be Bromley five or six miles to our
      right. I pointed that out to him and he agreed and then found his way to
      Biggin successfully. Once again on Terra firma I thought "If he can do it
      and get a licence I am sure I can" So I coughed up &#163;5 and joined the
      allouette flying group.<br>
