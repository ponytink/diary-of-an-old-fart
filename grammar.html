    <hr>
    Having won a scholarship I duly started in form 1D (Mr Pearce) in September
    1945. Of course, I met a whole gang of new friends. Each morning I would
    walk down to West Wickham station and catch the 8.16 to Clock House to
    arrive at school before 9.00 am for assembly. The train, I remember was
    always packed with businessmen on their way to the city. If you were lucky
    you could get a seat, but more likely had to stand for the four station
    journey. (about 10 minutes)<br>
    <br>
    On one such journey I can clearly remember reading aloud to a friend
    extracts from a book by "Leon Cortez" called Shakespear for the working
    man! It had the compartment in fits, because in my innocence I did not
    understand the innuendoes involved!
