          </center>As I laid on the sunbed (in the shade) by the pool, with a
          beer and reading my book, Valerie remarked that she had never seen me
          so relaxed. Well there was little else I could do stranded so far
          from home and with no computer, telephone or old ladies to visit!
          Anyway, it was a treat to sit quietly after the rush and tear of the
          past few days. We had been to so many places and seen so many things
          the mind was still boggling at the thought of it all. How would I
          remember all those facts the guides kept giving us. Old people are
          famous for short term memory loss and I am no exception! <b>The
          itinerary had been something like:-</b> Fri 11th. February. Free
