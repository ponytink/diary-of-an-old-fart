      Well, to start with, there was my Dad, the chap at the beginning of the
      story. He had spent the most part of his working life in Fleet Street
      working at first for the London Evening Standard and latterly for the
      Sunday Pictorial. In 1950 he resigned his position and was appointed
      distributor of newspapers and magazines for the area of Strood and
      Rochester. This was in April and I was still at school waiting to sit the
      school certificate examinations.

      Mrs Pierson had run the business throughout the war after her husband's
      death, and the business was somewhat depleted, the neighbouring Surridge
      Dawson's supplying magazines to a large proportion of the customers. In
      those days business was conducted in pubs, golf courses, coffee houses
      etc., and when an agreement was made, then your word was your bond, so to
      speak. By personal visits and reaching agreements Dad managed to regain
      the majority of the 'lost' business.

            Dad, the proud owner of a Ford Zephyr which had been resprayed
            red/stone. This replaced the ever popular Ford Prefect's he used to
            run. He had a new one each year for about &pound120 and
            received back &pound100 part exchange for the old one! That was
            from Peacock's of Balham where he was well in with the manager! As
            far back as before the war I was allowed to ride in the car up on
            the lift while the mechanic inspected the underneath and Dad and
            the manager went to the pub.<br>

    <img width="430" height="310" src="bradford.jpg" align="right"> When new
    vehicles were impossible to obtain and second hand ones were fetching
    treble the price of a new one he managed to acquire a Bradford Jowett Van.
    It had an air cooled, horizontally opposed twin cylinder engine. I had been
    taught to drive on his trusty black ford eight GVX 865 and was employed as
    a packer/driver.<br>
    <br>
    Here, you can see me on a monday afternoon giving our newly signwritten van
    a bath. I think I may have been a little 'rude' for the photograph!<br>
    <br>
    Under a similar arrangement he bought a second hand Bedford van - SME 954.
    I can clearly remember leaving the engine running while delivering
    newspapers to Tomlin's shop (Now the Shahanara) at the end of the Delce
    Road Rochester. When I went to open the rear doors of the van, the front
    door blew shut and dislodged the handbrake and the van started off down the
    hill towards Star Hill! I had to move pretty sharpish to get round to the
    front and open the drivers door, which opened backwards behind me, and jump
    in and regain control. - Scary!!<br>

    If you like numbers, as I do, you might like to know that one of my first
    jobs was to check the accuracy of the London Wholesaler's account to us.
    All the items were priced per dozen, some with 13/12 indicated. When there
    was a remainder, say 43 copies @ 4d. That would be priced as 3 dozen (13/12
    = 39) = (9/=d discounted @ 25%) for the dozens + in the margin 4 x 4d =
    16d. would be noted.<br>
    <br>
    The whole sheet was very large, poster size, double sided on stiff paper,
    with four or five columns each side. Right at the end would be the sum of
    the pennies, say for example, 2028d. These would be converted to
    &pound.s.d. and then discounted at 28%. Somewhere I will have kept a
    copy of one of these mammoth sheets and believe me it is a sight to
    behold!<br>

          <img width="550" height="440" src="nights.jpg" align="left"> We
          operated a similar accounting system for out customers, but on a
          smaller scale. Initially our weekly sheet had the main titles printed
          on the front ordered by the 'day of sale', and 'monthlies' on the
          back of the sheet. We had a 'goods inwards book' and if any monthlies
          were received, the sheet pricers, of which Mavis (my wife) was one,
          would check the goods inwards for 'monthlies'. If any were entered in
          but not charged, take the 'monthlies' order book and copy from that
          the quantities for each customer onto the back of his account sheet,
          and at the same time extend the price. Most publications had their
          own pricing structure and there were dozens of pricing tables propped
          up for the pricers to use. The quantities for weekly publications
          were a standing order, and details for each customers order would be
          copied over from one week to another, and then checked over between
          two people, one calling to the other to check the accuracy of the
          copying!<br>
          <br>
          Some publications arrived nearly a week in advance so those sheets
          were needed to advance pack those publications. We usually had three
          sets of sheets on the go at any one time. When the publications
          arrived in the warehouse, the label was cut from the parcel and
          spiked on a large metal spike. The detail was entered in the 'Goods
          In' book, and usually several publications were handled at one time
          in what was called 'a lay-up' A caller called the quantities to the
          packer who 'picked' the magazines, and marked a line through the item
          on the list indicating it had been packed. -When a block of packing
          had been completed, e.g. Mon/Tue/Wed blocks, the smaller earlier part
          of the week, the sheet pricer(s) would come and grab any sheets that
          were not being used to start the job of extending the values in the
          columns. Sometimes the packers would have the front part of the
          sheets and be packing for boxes 1 - 30, while the sheet pricers had
          sheets from 30 to the end. (We had about 60 boxes in those days).
          Then, when the packers were ready the sheets were swapped round. Of
          course, until the Saturday items, like the Grocer, Grocer's Gazette,
          Estates Gazette etc had been handled, the pricing could not begin,
          and the accounts would not be ready to be sent out until maybe the
          following Thursday

            Whilst clearing my garage the other day I came across a folder with
            some relics of the pre-computer age of accounting for the sale of
            newspapers and magazines to the retail trade which illustrate all
            the complexities which faced the school leavers in the pre-decimal
            age - baker's dozens or quires, accounting to the nearest farthing
            after the farthing had been withdrawn, and so on. Below I will show
            you some examples of our account sheets used in those days. - Oh!
            the memories!

            These sheets were implemented after visiting Bert and Barbara Petty
            from Reading. (He had a Volvo P1800 with an index plate "AEP 1" -
            Jealous!)<br>
            <br>
            He, like me lamented the repetitive weekly calculations, many
            customers never altering their order from one week to the next. He
            had devised the use of a photo copier whereby you only needed to
            alter the pricing relating to the items which had changed, and of
            course the total. To be sure of the systems accuracy a quarter of
            the sheets were totally checked each week.

            These sheets were printed off on a Gestetner machine (Sold to us by
            Jim Spackman). Each time a monthly magazine arrived for packing, a
            loose 6 x 4 index card was taken from the 'monthly tray' and the
            details entered on the back. i.e. date of packing, issue date,
            price and who packed it.<br>
            <br>
            Then after the magazine had been put in the customer pigeon holes
            (boxes) the card was dropped into the 'to be charged' box. When
            ever a slack 10 minutes arrived in the pricing dept., someone would
            come and see if there were any magazines to be charged and if so,
            the quantities on the card(s) would be added to the customer's
            sheets (these) and the card returned to the monthly tray in the
            metal filing cabinet.

          Whilst it was normal to have nothing much to do on a Monday, hence
          the washing of vehicles above, shortly after moving to 49 Cuxton Road
          there befell us a newspaper strike, and then later a magazine
          publishing strike. - It was catastrophic. Rather than stand us all
          off, dad had us paint the warehouse in and out.<br>
          <br>
          Here you can see me brush in hand as taught by Jack Wanstall, a
          painter and decorator who lived at 37 Smith Street. His wife, Rachel
          was my Mum's 'daily help'. What a wonderful person she was. _ Here I
          am fifty years later and still painting!!<br>
          <br>
          At this time, the popular newspapers sold at 1d. each. The trade
          price was 1/2d. a quire (26 copies) 1/2d. being 14 old pennies, or
          nearly 6p in todays currency - I remember this equated to a discount
          of 30.42%. We used to pay Fleet Street publishers 10d. a quire. All
          Newspapers were delivered "carriage paid home", whereas magazines
          were not necessarily. Most magazines were sold in quires of 26 and
          were priced by the dozen - 13/12 less 25%. - 13/12 meant that you
          received 25% discount from every copy up to 12, the the thirteenth
          one was given free. I still think that was a very good way of
          discounting for quantity. The bigger customers automatically
          receiving a graduated preferential discount. This method of charging
          out was laid down by the publishers in those days before the
          Monopolies Commision came into being in 1964. (How do I remember all
          this crap?) - as a 'frinstance' When I finished wholesaling in 1979,
          I remained in retail business at GORDON JAY LTD, the first thing I
          did was to put all the orders that came close to 13 copies, or
          multiples thereof, into multiples of 13! Our order for Radio Times
          was around 143 which gave 11 copies free! - It made quite a
          difference to the profit line. - Now the discount is around 25% at
          best, and no free copies!<br>
