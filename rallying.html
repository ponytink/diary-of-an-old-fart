      It was all Ralph Thomas's fault! - he had been the president of the
      R.C.D.M.C. for some little while when I first met him, probably through
      Freddy Wright. I came to join the motoring club and entered events like
      the Sunday afternoon treasure hunts, and Sunday afternoon driving tests.
      Major events were limited to 4 a year, and usually were run overnight.
      Harry Day and I entered one or two and came nowhere. The star of the
      events being Ralph Thomas, who owned a Simca. In the days of Ford eight
      or ten, with inadequate three speed gear boxes, the Simca had 1290 cc
      engine and a four speed gear box which gave it a great advantage over our
      sort of vehicle. At first I used the firm's Morris Minor shooting brake.
      I had it fitted with a servais four branch manifold and a 'straight
      through' exhaust. I had polished the cylinder head and it went like the
      wind. Unfortunately the brakes were 8" drum brakes and with repeated
      braking from around 90 mph they used to 'fade' and it was as if there
      were no brakes at all.<br>
      <br>
      On the night of our first 'big' rally, Dad lent me his Ford Zephyr. Quite
      a pokey car with a three speed box and a top speed of over 100 mph. Harry
      and I set off from the start, and about half way through the night we
      were in a foggy part of Kent, somewhere in the Tonbridge area and
      approaching a 'Y' junction Harry (my navigator) called "left at the
      junction" - then "no - right!" followed by sorry! left! by which time I
      was there and changed direction one too many times to mount the
      triangular grass road island at the junction. The car hissed and popped,
      steam emitting from all orifices! and we were stuck. After it had cooled
      a little I opened the bonnet to see all the hoses had come away from the
      radiator and the handbrake was pulled on, and the gear linkage mechanism
      was all fouled up. - Oh dear!! We called the AA and got towed to a garage
      in Tonbridge. Phoned the controller of the rally, resigned, got picked up
      and given a lift home. I phoned Dad and told him the car wouldn't be back
      in time to do the papers as it had been towed into a garage. - He said OK
      tell me about it tomorrow. I was very surprised at that. I had expected
      him to explode in an absolute rage.<br>
      <br>
      It transpired that the three engine mount bolts had been stripped of
      their threads by the engine hitting the grass and being forced violently
      upwards. This in turn allowed the engine to flop where ever it fancied,
      and of course a major repair was required. No more was said, and I was
      very grateful for that.
