    Dear Tony<br>
    <br>
    Thanks again for another very interesing E Mail. The reason I have been a
    bit slower in replying is;- I'VE BEEN SCRUTINISING YOUR WEB SITE !!! HA HA
    !!! VERY INTERESTING !! seriously, It IS very interesting. However, I am
    not very good at this newfangled technology stuff and I don't think that I
    have got all of it to go. I haven't got sound to work at all yet, and when
    I go into some of the feature pages they seem to "stop" suspended in mid
    flow (Is there a trick to turning over the next pages or is it the case
    that this is as far as you have got ?) Anyway, what I have seen is very
    interesting indeed.<br>
    <br>
    I have got a few minor corrections to report;- The first time you appeared
    at the Eagle tavern in Rochester was the summer of 1968 (not 1970) The band
    you heard was my first attempt at starting a Jazz Band. It was a "spin off"
    from an outfit I had managed to assemble to do the interval during the
    Maths School annual play (March 1968). I had known Colin Martin since we
    were both at Gordon Road school (from 1957, help!) and I had taught him the
    rudiments of Jazz piano playing, chord sequences etc, and he taken up the
    trumpet mainly because the "official" trumpet player I had drummed up
    (bullied into having a go at it) turned out to be totallly useless,
    absolutely no musical ability at all. This caused him extreme frustration
    as he was one of the highest achievers of our year at the Maths school,
    very good at all the subjects, but, when turning his considerable talents
    (which have been fulfilled by a very succesful career in insurance) he just
    couldn't do it to save his life!<br>
    <br>
    Colin actually turned up to one of our practice sessions( with trumpet) and
    immediately displayed far more ability and musical talent after just a few
    hours mucking about than the "official" guy had managed after about
    EIGHTEEN MONTHS. Colin showed him up so much that he quit straight away
    (about January 1968) and Colin got the job! However, despite iniitial
    promise, Colin hit a "brick wall" with trumpet playing quite soon, couldn't
    get anything approaching a good sound, so eventually returned to piano. The
    Eagle sessions (on fridays) came about because, after the school play
    finished, about 9pm on a friday in March, we "naturally" repaired over the
    road to the Eagle, taking our instruments, and were encouraged by the
    landlord to "have a blow". We did, and he offered us every friday (we were
    so green we didn't even ask for any MONEY !!!). The Eage scene folded in
    July, end of school and everybody went separate ways. Colin went to
    Southampton University, and I didn't really team up with him again until
    late 1969, by which time he had returned and started work with Kent County
    Council (he didn't survive the first year exams). The sad truth is, the
    Eagle scene didn't grow into anything. I had persuaded various friends to
    have a go at playing jazz but in truth, Jazz was already seen as "passe" by
    the teenagers of the 1960's and apart from Colin, they weren't really
    "bitten" by the bug. I had actually met you some time before.<br>
    <br>
    Can you remember John Caldwell ? He was one of your "paper boys" in 1966,
    and he was one of the "musical innocents" that I had rounded up. He had got
    hold of a very poor tenor banjo somehow, but wasn't a "natural" and didn't
    get very far with it. BUT he did tell me about this chap he worked for WHO
    PLAYED A TRUMPET!!! (and put a word in). I think you made an approach to my
    parents (to demonstrate that you were a leading upright citizen etc, and
    not a dangerous depraved maniac) and I was invited to play at the Bell,
    Bredgar <b>Bredhurst</b> (February 1967) This was with some of the
    musicians mentioned in your web site;- Roy Burton of course. Bernie on
    electric bass. and Fred on guitar. I also remember two others (but can't
    recall names) Some one on piano accordion (didn't really work) and a
    ferocious looking drummer with a very red face and very black moustache.
    This was all very heady stuff for a 17 year old, but I was pleased that I
    had learned the tunes at least, even though I was concerned that my
    technique of note production etc wasn't good enough (still isn't). You then
    invited me for a few further rehearsal sessions, in a bungalow just along
    Rede Court Road, just along from Strood Fire Station. (March - April 1967).
    This didn't seem to get anywhere at the time, and I think we lost touch for
    about a year until you turned up at the Eagle sessions. Dave Straker had
    showed up first a week or two before with tales of a fabulous jazz scene in
    Nottingham, which he was missing), and the rest, as they say, is
    history.<br>
    <br>
    Possibly the first regular things we did WERE the Cuxton social club gigs
    (starting from about may 1969, I think). I used to go to these by bike
    (from Shorne) and one night (late August?) there was a terrific
    thunderstorm. I used to carry my tenor in a rucksack on my back, which was
    quite heavy and caused balancing problems. On that night , the lightning
    "chased" me all along the Bush Road, always seemed to be about a hundred
    yards behind me, and I must have made an olympic standard speed back to
    Shorne, all uphill and probably slightly pissed too.<br>
    <br>
    ! Enough of these nostalgic ramblings !!! You are absolutely right about
    having lots of pastimes and interests. I have been fairly heavily dedicated
    to Jazz during the last ten years, but NOT EXCLUSIVELY !!! This is just as
    well, as the frustration that now attends it in its dotage would have been
    crippling. You have got one HUGE advantage over me though, and it does
    worry me greatly(not that I can do much about it). PEOPLE (Other people
    that is) . You are fortunate in having lots and lots of people around you
    to talk to and share life with. I haven't. All my family are dead now, we
    have no children, and Pamela only has her mother left, and she is 83 this
    year. As a consequence, we are very alone , I'm afraid. So many of the
    friends I have made are through music, and now that is just about over,
    then , you don't see those friends much. All the musicians in'this neck of
    the woods have retired (many have died) and so, the "local scene" is all
    but dead. I knew this would happen one day, so it's no surprise, but a bit
    disturbing nevertheless.<br>
    <br>
    We have a few friends in this part of the world, but not enough. Pamela is
    just so stressed by work that it is just not possible to develop any
    "social life" it seems. Anyway, I shall look forward very much to seeing
    you at the 100 club on June 15th . The doors open at 11.30, and there is
    always a long queue (really) these lunchtimes are very popular, usually
    attracting about 200 plus. Not eveyone who attends is an "old fogey from
    way back". There are always quite a number of younger pro musicians, with
    nothing else to do on a thursday lunchtime, and a surprising amount of
    other younger types at a loose end, together with tourists of course. This
    all makes for a very good lively atmosphere, almost like the good old days!
    If you drum up a few more "likely suspects" such as Don York or Ron Weller
    (always SAM to me) this would be great. As I said, my (very reliable) spies
    (be careful what you say, there are spies everywhere) have reported in no
    uncertain terms that DIXI are "the goods". I'm looking forward to it
    immensely, and , will be bringing along a friend of mine, Peter Davis, one
    of the stalwarts of the Kent Jazz scene (as a punter) in the 1970s, and now
    living only ten miles from me. (he knows you all right).<br>
    <br>
    All the very best to you and Mavis and all your fanily Alan Robinson
